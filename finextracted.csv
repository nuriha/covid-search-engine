With visits from Canadian customers having evaporated, many businesses in Madawaska, including gas stations and convenience stores, have been hit hard.                        Robbie Feinberg/Maine Public Radio                    Gary Theriault hops off his motorcycle and walks into the Tastee-Freez, a roadside ice cream and takeout stand just a short hop from the Canadian border, in Madawaska, Maine. As he waits for his milkshake, Theriault peers across the St. John River towards Edmundston, New Brunswick. He says the two communities have long been linked by their heritage and connected economies. ""Well, a good example is, my mother was born in Edmundston, which is right across the border,"" Theriault says. ""My father was born in Van Buren. So half my relatives are over there, and the other half are over here. So there's a lot of back-and-forth. Visiting aunts, uncles, grandparents. It was always a back-and-forth with the border.""  National U.S.-Canada Border Community's Culture Changes As Security Tightens Since the 1970s, the population in Madawaska has fallen to less than 4,000 as the local paper mill has laid off workers. But residents say the town's relationship with its Canadian neighbors has helped keep business alive. Locals say Americans go to Edmundston to see family, gamble at the casino, or get a haircut. Canadians come to Madawaska for the cheaper gas and milk.  But most of those visits came to a halt in March, when the U.S. and Canada blocked nonessential travel across the border, temporarily separating many of the cultural, historic and economic ties linking many border communities. Theriault says he can still cross to get parts for his garage door businesses. But other travel, like to see family, has stopped. ""So I was crossing every day. I was residing there, and working here,"" he says. ""Then when the decision came, that they were closing the borders, because my business is probably 95% in the states, we made the decision at that time to stay here until things can iron themselves out.""  Many businesses in Madawaska, including gas stations and convenience stores, were hit hard when visits from Canadian customers evaporated. ""Probably 60% of my business is Canadians. So when they closed the bridge down...we let our workers go,"" says Tim Lausier, a part-owner of Bob's Service Center, a gas station about a mile from the border crossing.  Coronavirus Live Updates U.S., Canada Agree To Keep Border Partly Closed For Another 30 Days""So it's just my sister and I working the store now. And it's been like that for two months. And it looks like it's going to be like that for another month. And I've lost, probably, 2,500 people coming through the door a week."" Lausier says he understands the need to maintain restrictions and protect public health. But he worries that even if the border does reopen soon, ""people are going to be scared to come over here,"" he says. ""I don't think it'll be back to normal. It might take five or six years, I think."" The concerns have led some local business owners — and even a state legislator in Maine — to push for the federal government to reopen parts of the border. But federal officials have said the border will remain closed to non-essential travel until at least June 22nd, and won't be permitted until the administration is ""convinced that doing so is safe and secure."""

Malte Mueller/Getty Images                    A strange thing happened this spring. As co-workers began to get sick, essential worker Yudelka LaVigna took an unpaid leave of absence. When she got her unemployment benefits, she realized something unheard of: She was making more money not working. ""That just kind of opens your eyes,"" says LaVigna, who's now back at her New York call center job for essential services. When the government shut down the U.S. economy in a bid to tame the spread of the coronavirus, Congress scrambled to help tens of millions of people who lost jobs. The government rushed one-time relief checks to all families that qualified and tacked an extra $600 onto weekly unemployment benefits, which are usually less than regular pay and vary by state. But so far, lawmakers have not passed any measure to increase pay for workers who were asked to keep going to work during a highly contagious health crisis. Some companies did create hazard, or ""hero,"" pay — typically around $2 extra an hour or a one-time bonus. Most have since ended it.  So those boosted unemployment checks have created a bizarre distortion in the labor market, where holding on to a job doesn't guarantee being financially better off than losing one.  The Coronavirus Crisis As 'Hero' Pay Ends, Essential Workers Wonder What They Are WorthLaVigna says it's a weird imbalance. ""You feel like, you guys [the government] never have money for people that really need it, and all of a sudden you have money for everybody,"" she says. ""But then the people that are still essentially working don't get the recognition that they deserve."" Few employers have compensated extra for on-site work amid the health crisis. A recent survey by the Economic Policy Institute found that fewer than a third of people who had to leave their homes to work during the pandemic received additional pay or benefits. As U.S. coronavirus cases persist and some states are even backtracking their reopening plans, workers have flooded social media with calls for hazard pay. The Facebook group ""Give Essential Workers Essential Pay"" drew nearly 4,000 members in a matter of weeks: cashiers and bus drivers, pharmacy technicians and sanitation workers, welders and machinists. They post pictures of the thank-you gifts their companies have sent them: hats, bracelets, T-shirts and gift cards.  The Indicator from Planet Money How Other Countries Handled Their Jobs Crises ""We got videos from our employer saying thank you. We got musicians from the Grammys, or whatever, saying thank you. ... If we're so thanked and so important, why don't they write a bill for us?"" says Nick Stone, an essential worker at a Nevada plant that supplies rock and other material for roadway, housing and other construction projects. ""Think about the coal miners that go underground and risk their lives, and why their wages are increased compared to a surface miner,"" says Stone, a longtime miner. ""This pandemic was the same thing. We [essential workers] let everybody stay at home, and we put the country on our back to carry it. ... But we didn't choose to do this. This was asked of us."" Many social media conversations about hazard pay inevitably bring up the extra $600 weekly in unemployment benefits that workers wish they received too. It's a stark reminder of just how much of a difference that money can make to millions of working families.  Business How Coronavirus Could Widen The Gender Wage Gap Planet Money Money And JusticeStudies have begun to show that the additional pandemic aid threw a critical lifeline to low-income households, keeping many from poverty. It was easier to access compared with the typically onerous bureaucracy of U.S. safety-net programs. And experts who study poverty say that this money did a better job approximating a living wage than many minimum-wage jobs do. ""All of a sudden when we actually want to help people, we think that $600 a week is the kind of amount that seems reasonable,"" says Liz Ananat, an economics professor at Barnard College, Columbia University. ""I was honestly astonished by $600 a week, because it was so generous compared to what I'm used to looking at."" But the short-lived pandemic boost ends at the end of July. Ananat's research also suggests that roughly half of those who've lost work are still waiting for their unemployment checks. Many have no savings to fall back on. Essential workers understand that the situation is messy. ""I'm not angry at anyone receiving that [unemployment]. I can't be angry, because you have to still feed your family,"" says Sandra Ellington, a custodial worker at the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in Ohio.

And it has been months since she has hugged her mom, who's 70 and used to come over for a cup of coffee on the porch a few times a week, but had to stop. Ellington has seen her from the car while dropping off supplies. They say ""I love you"" to each other from a distance. ""We've worked through it all. ...

Spencer Platt/Getty Images                    Updated at 5 p.m. ET Employers added a record 4.8 million jobs last month, as the U.S. economy continued to slowly bounce back from a deep and painful coronavirus recession.  The unemployment rate dipped to 11.1%. Job growth accelerated from May, when revised figures show employers added 2.7 million jobs.   Loading...  ""Our economy is roaring back,"" President Trump told reporters in the White House briefing room. ""It's coming back extremely strong."" What's odd this time is that the closely-watched monthly jobs report offers a snapshot of the economy that was already somewhat out of date as soon as it was issued.  The Labor Department report reflects conditions from the middle of June. The COVID-19 outbreak has since been accelerating in many states, which could put the brakes on the nascent economic recovery. Investors welcomed the positive jobs news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 92 points while the Nasdaq composite index hit a new, record high. ""This is not just luck, what's happening. This is a lot of talent,"" Trump said in response to the stock market gains.  Loading...  About 40% of the job gains last month were in leisure and hospitality — a sector that was hard hit early in the pandemic.  In just the past week, governors in Florida and Texas have ordered bars to close for a second time in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. California has halted indoor restaurant dining and closed movie theaters for most of its residents. Arizona has also shut down water parks and gyms for 30 days.  Many states have paused their reopening plans.  And even in the absence of government orders, people tend to be more cautious about going out and spending money when there's an uptick in coronavirus infections. Tucson, Ariz., bartender Karen Schenck noticed a sharp drop in business as the pandemic gained ground there.  ""We're risking our health for peanuts,"" says Schenck. ""You go from making $80 in tips in a couple of hours and now you're doing $15. How can anybody make a car payment?"" Unemployment declined for all workers. Latinos saw the biggest improvement. The jobless rate for African Americans fell only slightly, and at 15.4%, it is now the highest for any racial group.   The official unemployment rate has been artificially low for the last several months, because some people who are out of work have been misclassified as employed. The Labor Department says that problem persisted in June, but it's shrinking. Even if all workers had been properly classified, the unemployment rate would have declined in both May and June.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin acknowledged that unemployment remains extremely high by historical standards.  ""We're going to be concerned till every single person is back to work,"" Mnuchin said. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has cautioned that the outlook remains ""extraordinarily uncertain.""  ""A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities,"" Powell said in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this week.   Still, Powell was encouraged by the resurgence of economic activity when people returned to their jobs last month. Sixto Zermeno was one of them. The veteran hotel bellman went back to work in early June when casinos reopened in Las Vegas.  But Zermeno had been back on the job for only a few days when he got sick with the coronavirus. He has recovered but remains in quarantine.   ""I'm a hard worker, so if you tell me to go to work, I'm going to go to work,"" Zermeno said. ""But I feel nervous now because of how contagious this is. I never knew how easy this spreads."" The culinary union, which represents Zermeno and other Vegas workers, is suing several casino operators, saying they're not doing enough to protect their workers. Tallies from companies that make scheduling software such as Kronos and HomeBase suggest workers' hours have declined in the most recent weeks in parts of the country where infections have spiked.  ""The economic outlook isn't just evolving month by month or week by week. It is changing day by day and hour by hour,"" said Dave Gilbertson, vice president of strategy and operations at Kronos. ""While payroll data lags by several weeks and longer, shift data is available is near real-time."""

Lauren Van Netta                    Many people with underlying medical conditions are worried about what's going to happen at the end of the month. It's not currently safe for many of them to go back to work. The COVID-19 death rate is 12 times higher for people with underlying conditions. But an extra $600 a week in federal unemployment benefits, which has been enabling them to pay their rent and other bills, will stop coming at the end of July.  ""We don't have a whole lot of options that don't involve risking our lives,"" Lauren Van Netta says. ""We need help. We really do.""  Van Netta lost her job at a perfume store in New Orleans during the outbreak.  She says she's had serious bacterial infections that have damaged her lungs and compromised her immune system. And she has asthma. So even if she could find another job in retail, she says her doctors have told her it would be risky.

Before her unemployment money started coming, she says she sold her favorite pair of boots for $120 just to have some cash to buy food. ""It was pretty stressful."" Since then, she's had enough to live on thanks to the expanded unemployment benefits. But Congress only authorized that extra $600 a week until the end of the month — even for people with underlying health conditions. And Van Netta says her state benefits alone, about $220 a week, won't pay the bills.    The Coronavirus Crisis Zoom Call Eviction Hearings: 'They'll Throw Everything I Have Out On The Street' Under the CARES Act, people with underlying conditions are supposed to be able to stay on unemployment even if they are offered a job if it's one they can't do remotely. But in those cases, too, the $600 ends at the end of July. So public health and worker rights advocates say they worry that if that extra money stops, many people will be forced to take jobs unsafe for them.  Democrats in Congress want to extend those expanded benefits. But Republicans have expressed concern that the extra money is keeping some people from going back to work in lower paying jobs. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking.  ""It's absolutely critical that it's figured out before this expires in July,"" says Sharon Block, executive director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School and a former senior Labor Department official. She says the need is particularly urgent ""when you consider that we are in an expanding pandemic and not an ebbing one.""  Your Money Are You Ready To Go Back To Work?

He doesn't want his last name used because he fears repercussions at work. His wife has lupus, an autoimmune disease, and he says she takes medicine that suppresses her immune system. ""So we knew that that was immediately gonna be something that we had to take additional precautions for,"" he says. Alan was working remotely until mid-May when he says his employer insisted that everybody return to work at the office. But he says the company is taking almost no safety precautions.

""We say we're all in this together; there's millions of people in the same situation that my wife and I are in, with one of us being at higher risk.""

Hector Vivas/Getty Images                    Near downtown Mexico City, Cristian Corte sells tacos and gorditas at a makeshift stand outside a metro stop. He pulls down his thin paper mask, anxious to vent his anger about the Mexican president's upcoming trip to Washington, D.C. ""I want him to tell Trump to stop stepping all over us and to treat everyone as equals,"" says Corte. On Friday, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador appeared to be talking to Mexicans like Corte, skeptical of his visit on Wednesday and Thursday to the White House. ""We are going ... with our heads high, as representatives of this great people of this great country,"" said López Obrador. His critics don't see it that way. Former diplomats, columnists and political pundits have taken to social media and the airwaves daily to decry the visit. Many say López Obrador is making a huge mistake by going, that he is once again giving in to President Trump's whims and that he's helping the U.S. president politically during a tough reelection campaign.  ""It is a very risky move,"" said Denise Dresser, a professor and political commentator in Mexico City. ""Forever the Mexican president will be captured in a photograph standing next to someone who Mexicans view as xenophobic, as racist, as a leader who has humiliated Mexicans. ... By standing next to him, López Obrador validates those positions,"" she said. Others say López Obrador is using the trip as a distraction from domestic troubles, especially the rising rate of infections from the coronavirus. Last week, Mexico surpassed Spain in the number of COVID-19 deaths. Like Trump, López Obrador does not wear a mask in public and has opted for opening the economy over onerous lockdown measures. López Obrador has also said he has no need to get tested for the virus, even though several officials near him, including his treasury secretary, have tested positive. Adding to López Obrador's risk, he will be flying on a commercial airline to Washington, D.C. He refuses to use the presidential plane, calling it too extravagant for a country as poor as Mexico. Without a direct flight from Mexico City to D.C., López Obrador will have to make a stop in a major U.S. city and arrive the night before his meeting with Trump. And he'll have to get tested in the U.S. too. White House spokesman Judd Deere says everyone in the Mexican traveling delegation will be tested for COVID-19. Despite all the health and political risks, Roberto Velasco, head of North American relations in Mexico's Foreign Ministry, says the trip is a vital trade and commercial mission. López Obrador wants to celebrate the start of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that went into effect last week, said Velasco. ""We do not get to pick and choose which governments we work with and which we don't, when there are citizens of ours and commercial interests and such important bilateral affairs to attend as is the case with the U.S.,"" he added. For many Mexicans, though, the visit isn't such bad timing. Saúl Hernández, a construction worker on the site of a new apartment high-rise near downtown Mexico City, says maybe the presidents' meeting can help the bad economy. ""I hope they do something good and get investment to come here because jobs are hard to come by these days in Mexico,"" he said. Mexico has lost more than a million formal jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic and is slipping further into recession. A recent poll showed that a majority of Mexicans are in favor of López Obrador meeting with Trump, even though the Mexican president's own popularity is slipping. Carlos Bravo Regidor, a professor at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching in Mexico City, says López Obrador isn't going to lose too much support over the Trump visit. ""For Mexican standards López Obrador is still quite a positive president, his base sticks with him. It's chipping away but it is chipping away slowly,"" he said. Bravo, who opposes López Obrador's visit, is a bit conciliatory, saying it must be tough to be president of Mexico with Trump in the White House. ""It's not like the president of Mexico can get in a fight with Trump. ... One way or the other we have to reckon with the fact that we have such an anti-Mexican president in the White House and find a way to work with him,"" he said."

""Get open in the fall. We want your schools open,"" Trump said.  The president spoke alongside first lady Melania Trump, administration officials and teachers as part of planned programming from the White House to push for the reopening of schools. Despite Trump's comments, senior administration officials said on a background call with reporters Tuesday morning that the decision to reopen public schools remains a local one.  ""Our goal right now is to work hand in hand with the local jurisdictions now to help let them see the best ways to reopen these schools in a safe way and get back to where we would have really preferred to have been through the spring of this year, which was to have that active educational component available to the students,"" one official said. On Monday, Trump tweeted, ""SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!"" However, during Tuesday's event, the president said he doesn't want to see the issue politicized.  ""We hope that most schools are going to be open. We don't want people to make political statements or do it for political reasons. They think it's gonna be good for them politically so they keep the schools closed,"" Trump elaborated. ""No way.""  It's not the first time Trump has linked the reopening of schools with political intentions. He previously tweeted that presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden doesn't want schools to open in the fall for ""political reasons."" He did not elaborate on what that means.  Coronavirus Live Updates Florida Orders Schools To Reopen In The Fall For In-Person Instruction Administration officials acknowledged the risk of students spreading the contagion to more vulnerable populations but emphasized that school closures disrupt ""critical services to children and their families."" They promised the administration would share ""best practices"" with states on reopening in accordance with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but offered no concrete proposals on how states might mitigate risks to students and their families should schools reopen. During the roundtable, the first lady emphasized the holistic experience of school that children have been missing out on during the pandemic.  ""When children are out of school, they're missing more than just time in the classroom,"" she said. ""They're missing the laughter of their friends, learning from their teachers and the joy of recess and play."" Education groups have asked for at least $200 billion in federal funding to reopen safely and plug holes in state budgets due to the recession. So far, $13.5 billion has been appropriated to K-12 education. The Republican-controlled Senate has not taken up a bill passed by House Democrats that would allocate hundreds of billions more. The shuttering of schools this spring has taken an economic toll. Many parents are working from home alongside their children as they receive online education. In guidance issued last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics called for bringing children back to the classroom this fall wherever and whenever it can be done safely.  Tuesday's programming also included a call between Vice President Pence and governors (which administration officials said was his second such call) and a panel discussion with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos led by Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The push to reopen schools follows new regulations released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that foreign students attending American colleges operating online cannot remain in the country, forcing schools to weigh the risk of holding in-person classes with losing their international students. Trump criticized Harvard University for its announcement on Monday that all classes will be online in the fall. ""I think it's ridiculous,"" he said. ""I think it's an easy way out, and they ought to be ashamed of themselves."" NPR education correspondent Anya Kamenetz contributed to this report."

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images                    Updated at 11:55 a.m. ET Several Republican senators say they will not attend the Republican National Convention to renominate President Trump in Jacksonville, Fla., in August. So far, Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine are expected to skip the gathering the week of Aug. 24. Also not going, per their aides, are Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who voted for Trump's removal from office during the Senate impeachment trial, and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who last month said she wasn't sure she could support Trump's reelection.  Grassley, 86, said on a call with local reporters on Monday that he'll miss the convention as a result of pandemic fears. He also noted it will mark the first time he won't attend in 40 years.  ""I'm not going to go. And I'm not going to go because of the virus situation,"" Grassley told The Des Moines Register and others.  This year's Republican convention has faced a turbulent path. It was originally slated for Charlotte, N.C., but the bulk of it was moved last month to Jacksonville following Trump's demands for fewer safety precautions from COVID-19. Official convention business will still be conducted in Charlotte.   Elections Trump's Drive On Division And Fear May Not Be A Winning Strategy Come November Book News & Features 'The Stakes Are Far Higher Than They've Ever Been': Trump's Niece Pens Tell-AllNow, as pandemic cases spiral upward in Florida, there are new calls to scale down the event there.  A statement from Alexander's office didn't directly point to the coronavirus as a concern, but instead said that his spot should be used by someone else. Alexander is 80 and retiring from the Senate.  ""Senator Alexander is an honorary chair of the Tennessee Trump campaign, but he will not be attending the convention because he believes the delegate spots should be reserved for those who have not had that privilege before as he has had,"" the statement said.  As for Collins, an aide said she's skipping as part of a long-running tradition not to go during reelection years. Collins ""never made plans to attend the convention because she has never attended the national convention in years when she is up for election,"" the aide said. In 2016, when she was not on the ballot, Collins attended the convention despite saying she would not support Trump. Several other GOP offices contacted by NPR didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but at least three so far plan to attend. Aides for both South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said they'll be there.  ""The leader has every intention of attending,"" a McConnell aide said.  And Indiana Sen. Mike Braun tweeted this week that he'll join the event as well.  Trump holds an outdoor campaign rally Saturday in Portsmouth, N.H. The state's Republican governor, Chris Sununu, has said he would welcome Trump to New Hampshire but skip the rally himself."

Alex Brandon/AP                    Congressional Democrats have accused U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos of trying to reroute hundreds of millions of dollars in coronavirus aid money to K-12 private school students. The coronavirus rescue package, known as the CARES Act, included more than $13 billion to help public schools cover pandemic-related costs.  In a Wednesday letter co-signed by Rep. Bobby Scott, Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the lawmakers said DeVos' efforts run ""in contravention of both the plain reading of the statute and the intent of Congress."" Scott is chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, and Murray is the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. This admonition comes about three weeks after DeVos issued guidance suggesting that private schools should benefit from a representative share of the emergency aid.  Coronavirus Live Updates Coronavirus Relief Package Offers Up More Than $30 Billion For EducationMost of the money set aside for schools in the CARES Act is meant to be distributed based on how many vulnerable, low-income students a district serves, the lawmakers said — the same way the federal government hands out Title I dollars. It's an old formula meant to send money where it's needed, including to some low-income private school students in the form of ""equitable services"" such as tutoring or transportation. In the Education Department's interpretation of the CARES Act, though, the agency argues that private schools should receive these subsidized services based on how many students they serve overall, rather than just their share of low-income students. This could mean, in places with large private school populations, districts serving low-income students could be required to spend relief money on more affluent, private school neighbors.   In practice, here's what the difference would look like: In Louisiana, under the low-income student formula, the state Department of Education reports private school students would receive services worth $8.6 million of the state's CARES Act relief money. Under the department's broader interpretation, that share would jump to $31.5 million — a 267% increase.    Coronavirus Live Updates Small, Private Colleges Get Boost From Coronavirus Relief FundsThe department's initial guidance, issued on April 30, confused many school leaders, prompting a letter from the Council of Chief State School Officers, telling DeVos that, if the guidance is not revised, it ""could significantly harm the vulnerable students who were intended to benefit the most"" from the CARES Act relief. In a letter to New Jersey's governor, the head of the Education Law Center, a policy and advocacy group, calls DeVos' directive ""a patent misreading"" of federal law and warns that, under this interpretation, Newark Public Schools would have to redirect an additional $800,000 of aid from its own pupils to area private school students. Tennessee's schools chief has reportedly said she plans to abide by the department's guidance, though other school leaders have been defiant, noting that the directive is not legally binding.   On May 12, Indiana's Republican superintendent of public instruction, Jennifer McCormick, tweeted that, after consulting with her state's attorney general, she would ignore the guidance. ""I will not play political agenda games with [COVID-19] relief funds,"" she said. IN will distribute funds according to Congressional intent and a plain reading of the law.  I will not play political agenda games with COVID relief funds. Our most at-risk students depend on this commitment. https://t.co/Jrp56vxR1e— Jennifer McCormick (@suptdrmccormick) May 12, 2020Scott, chairman of the House education committee, said in a statement to NPR that ""there is rightfully pushback"" to the department's position. ""The actions of the Department of Education have left states and districts stuck between compliance with the law and adhering to ideologically motivated guidance,"" he said. In a statement, Education Department press secretary Angela Morabito insisted the department is in the right: ""Congress directed the Department to make sure all students are able to be served through the CARES Act."" The statement went on to say, if school districts ""were to only count Title I eligible students, they would be placing non-public school students and teachers at a disadvantage that Congress did not intend."" On Thursday, speaking remotely to reporters, the Republican chair of the Senate education committee, Sen. Lamar Alexander, was asked if he agreed with DeVos' interpretation: ""I thought, and I think most of Congress thought, that money from the CARES Act would be distributed in the same way that Title I is distributed.""

""It will be safe for Texas public school students, teachers, and staff to return to school campuses for in-person instruction this fall,"" the commissioner said in a statement. ""But there will also be flexibility for families with health concerns so that their children can be educated remotely, if the parent so chooses."" He did not offer any information on whether students would be required to wear masks and whether there would be social distancing precautions.

Ross D. Franklin/AP                    The nation's pediatricians have come out with a strong statement in favor of bringing children back to the classroom this fall wherever and whenever they can do so safely. The American Academy of Pediatrics' guidance ""strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school."" The guidance says ""schools are fundamental to child and adolescent development and well-being."" The AAP cites ""mounting evidence"" that transmission of the coronavirus by young children is uncommon, partly because they are less likely to contract it in the first place. On the other hand, the AAP argues that based on the nation's experience this spring, remote learning is likely to result in severe learning loss and increased social isolation. Social isolation, in turn, can breed serious social, emotional and health issues: ""child and adolescent physical or sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation."" Furthermore, these impacts will be visited more severely on Black and brown children, as well as low-income children and those with learning disabilities.    The Coronavirus Crisis What Parents Can Learn From Child Care Centers That Stayed Open During LockdownsThe guidance for returning to in-person schooling  includes recommendations about physical distancing, cleaning and disinfection, hand-washing, and using outdoor spaces whenever possible.  The AAP argues that offering elementary school children the opportunity to go to school every day should be given due consideration over spacing guidelines if capacity is an issue: ""Schools should weigh the benefits of strict adherence to a 6-feet spacing rule between students with the potential downside if remote learning is the only alternative.""  And, it also argues that masks are probably not practical for children younger than middle school unless they can wear a mask without increased face touching.  The guidelines do note that adult school staff are more at risk compared to young children and need to be able to distance from other adults as much as possible — no in-person faculty meetings, no class visits by parents. And they emphasize the need to make accommodations for  students who are medically fragile or have special health care needs or disabilities. However, these guidelines don't necessarily address the health concerns of America's teachers or their willingness to return to in-person teaching. Federal data show nearly a third of teachers are over 50, putting them in a higher risk category when it comes to the disease.  Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia, for example, recently announced its reopening plans, offering families a choice between two days a week of in-person classes or an all-remote schedule plus extra intervention on a third day for students who need it. The county's three educator unions resisted, arguing in a statement that remote learning should continue. ""Our educators are overwhelmingly not comfortable returning to schools,"" said Tina Williams, president of Fairfax County Federation of Teachers. ""They fear for their lives, the lives of their students and the lives of their families."""

Ron DeSantis said last week that the state was ""not going back"" on reopening, saying younger people were driving the spike but that they were at less risk than older people.  Republican Miami Mayor Francis X. Suarez called the growth ""extremely worrisome"" and said the growth was partially due to the early reopening of the state. ""There's no doubt that the fact that when we reopened, people started socializing as if the virus didn't exist,"" he told ABC News. Democratic Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego told ABC News that the state opened up too quickly and criticized the federal government's response to the virus and the lack of testing across the state. The Arizona Republic reported that in some cases, people have had to wait in line for 13 hours to be tested. ""We opened way too early in Arizona,"" Gallego said. ""We were one of the last states to go to stay-at-home and one of the first to reemerge. And we reemerged at zero to 60."" In response to the surging cases in Arizona, authorities in Mexico tightened restrictions on some border crossings over the weekend and closed popular beaches to limit nonessential holiday travel. At the same time, President Trump said Saturday that, while cases are increasing, his administration has made ""a lot of progress"" slowing the spread of the virus. He blamed the increase in cases on the increase of testing, which experts argue is an incorrect evaluation of the spread of the disease."

Paras Griffin/Getty Images                    Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has tested positive for the coronavirus but said Tuesday that her only possible symptom is a headache.  The diagnosis comes at an intense time for the city, which is reeling from the police killing of Rayshard Brooks and a spike in violence over the Fourth of July weekend. Bottoms announced her positive test on Twitter on Monday. ""This is the same headache that I have during stressful times and allergy season,"" she told ABC's Good Morning America on Tuesday. The mayor said doctors told her she had a ""low positive"" test, meaning that she was either at the beginning or near the end of her infection. One of her children has tested positive, and she told CNN that her husband tested positive as well. Bottoms added that neither she nor her husband has underlying heath conditions.

The Georgia State Patrol headquarters was also ransacked recently, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  Bottoms said that she disagreed with Kemp's order and said that she thought the governor's reopening plan for the state was too aggressive.  When asked about the surge in violence in Atlanta, Bottoms pointed to concerns surrounding police brutality and the increasing spread of the coronavirus.

Shots - Health News As States Reopen, Do They Have The Workforce They Need To Stop Coronavirus Outbreaks?When both new and total case counts grow quickly, the curve bends upward. As cases slow, the curve levels or bends down. In New York, site of the country's largest outbreak, the state's curve rose sharply before reaching over 170,000 total cases in April. Since then, new cases have fallen from about 10,000 per day in mid-April to fewer than 700 per day in late June.   Some states, such as Hawaii, have declined to just a dozen new cases per day, while others are growing. Arizona, which had leveled off at around 15,000 total cases in May, saw a sudden sharp spike in new cases in June.  Loading...  The coronavirus has hit some states much harder than others. For much of the pandemic, a large share of U.S. cases have been centered around New York City. As of early June, New York state, Connecticut and New Jersey accounted for about 30% of total cases in the nation and 42% of deaths, although new cases have been dropping in these three states. Across the country, other large, populous states such as California, Illinois and Texas have high totals as well. Some smaller states have had a heavy burden of disease relative to their population size, such as Nebraska and Iowa, which have high case counts per capita, and Louisiana and Michigan which have a high death count per capita.

There may be discrepancies between what you see here and what you see on your local health department's website. Figures shown do not include cases on cruise ships. In early June, Michigan health authorities started including probable cases in its totals. This resulted in a brief spike in the state's daily numbers until the JHU team was able to reconcile the historical data. On June 25, New Jersey included 1,854 previously-unreported probable deaths in its totals, resulting in a spike in the state's daily death numbers.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/u-s-consumers-reduced-their-borrowing-by-18-3-billion-in-may,U.S. consumers reduced their borrowing by $18.3 billion in May,Martin Crutsinger,"['Jul 8, 2020']","WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumers reduced their borrowing for a third straight month in May as the millions of jobs lost because of the coronavirus pandemic made households less eager to take on new debt.The Federal Reserve reported Wednesday that consumer borrowing declined by $18.3 billion in May, a drop of 5.3%. Borrowing had fallen 4.5% in March and then plunged 20.1% in April. That was the biggest one-month decline in percentage terms since the end of World War II.Borrowing by consumers in the category that covers credit card debt fell $24.3 billion in May following Aprils record $58.2 billion decline. Borrowing in the category that covers auto loans and student debt rose $6 billion, reversing part of a $12 billion decline in April.Consumer borrowing is closely watched because of clues it can provide about the willingness of households to take on more debt to support consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of U.S. economic activity.Economists believe that the widespread shutdowns triggered by efforts to contain the coronavirus pushed the economy into a deep downturn, with the gross domestic product expected to post a record-breaking decline of 30% in the April-June quarter.The Trump administration is forecasting a sharp rebound in the July-September quarter but private economists are worried that the resurgence of coronavirus cases in recent weeks in many areas may put the recovery at risk.It marked the first time in a decade that overall consumer borrowing has fallen for three straight months. The declines left total borrowing at a seasonally adjusted $4.11 trillion in May.Nancy Vanden Houten, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said that while consumer spending did show a big gain in May, consumers financed the increased spending with their savings and not through higher borrowing.She said that she expected credit card borrowing would decline this year due to restrained consumer outlays and tighter credit card lending standards. But she said that the category that covers auto and student loans would likely show modest growth.The Feds monthly credit report does not include home mortgages or any other type of loans secured by real estate such as home equity loans."

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-tech-giants-could-be-doing-to-help-close-racial-gaps-in-health,What tech giants could be doing to help close racial gaps in health,Erin Brodwin,"['Jul 8, 2020']","As the nation confronts a reckoning over racial inequality, tech giants — with their vast budgets, institutional power, and growing focus on health — could be well-positioned to make a difference. They could invest in health tech initiatives to close racial gaps in local communities, conduct inclusive research, and create more affordable, accessible products.But for the most part, that isnt happening. In fact, while executives from Facebook, Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft have all condemned racism in public statements, none of the statements made mention of how they plan to address racism in health or health care.STAT asked spokespeople at five big tech companies working in health — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft — whether they have any health projects dedicated to addressing inequality. Only Alphabet provided concrete examples, including an effort by Google to map U.S. health disparities with the Morehouse School of Medicine and an initiative by Verily to enroll more women and people of color in clinical trials. Spokespeople for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft declined to comment on specific projects, pointing instead to their chief executives recent statements.But by and large, those statements detail plans to address racism without tackling its impact on health.READ MORE: Racial bias skews algorithms widely used to guide care from heart surgery to birth, study findsApple CEO Tim Cook announced last month that his company was committing $100 million to a new racial equity and justice initiative focused on education and criminal justice reform. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, meanwhile, penned a blog post citing the companys ongoing work on criminal justice reform as evidence of his companys commitment to addressing inequality.A Facebook spokeswoman also pointed STAT to a list of the companys existing health projects, such as a preventive health tool designed to nudge people toward health screenings.Outside experts cautioned that those approaches run the risk of ignoring the disparities that place Black individuals and other people of color on unequal footing compared with white people. That means some of techs health ambitions could — perhaps unintentionally — worsen inequalities, rather than helping to reduce them, they said.The industry needs to take greater responsibility for how the tools it makes can contribute to racial inequality.The industry needs to take greater responsibility for how the tools it makes can contribute to racial inequality, said Kate Crawford, co-founder and lead researcher at the AI Now Institute at New York University.Facebooks preventive health tool, for example, does not collect data on the race or ethnicity of users who engage with the tool. Some experts said that makes it impossible to know whether the tool is reaching members of underrepresented groups.Its just like with Covid-19: We didnt know there was an issue until we started collecting data on race and ethnicity, said Adewole Adamson, a dermatologist who co-authored a 2018 paper which concluded that machine learning dermatology research based predominantly on white datasets can lead to worse outcomes for Black individuals and other people of color.Other problems can arise when tech solutions are developed without a proper accounting of race and ethnicity, according to clinicians and startup executives.For example, several smartwatches rely on green light to measure heart rate. But because skin with more melanin blocks green lights shorter wavelength, the tools are less accurate for Black individuals and other people of color. Fitbits, Samsung watches, and several other brands use only green lights; a Fitbit spokesperson said it boosted the current in an effort to address the issue. In addition to green light, the Apple Watch also uses infrared sensors, which appear to make the technology more reliable when used on a variety of skin tones.The potential for baked-in bias has cropped up in a number of other health tech tools and datasets. At-home genetic tests suffer from an underrepresentation of Black individuals and other people of color in their data, for example, while a commonly used hospital algorithm trained on a biased dataset was found to lead to worse outcomes for Black and Latinx people.Experts said the problem, in part, is that such tools have been designed without a deep understanding of the ways in which structural racism shapes health. In the case of the hospital algorithm, for example, the system used cost to prioritize patients medical needs — which proved to be problematic, because health spending for Black patients was less than for white patients.But, experts said, techs shortcomings on addressing racial disparities in health is also the product of disparities within tech companies themselves. The staff and leadership of many major tech companies remains overwhelmingly white — potentially impacting everything from product design to decisions about what types of health research are worth investment. Experts said that diversifying their own staffs will be a critical first step for tech companies, who need to do better at recruiting and retaining people from underrepresented backgrounds, including Black people and other people of color.If your decision-makers all look the same, youre going to come up with some biased tools, Adamson said.If your decision-makers all look the same, youre going to come up with some biased tools.Beyond diversifying internally, the tech companies can and should be taking other steps, such as investing in health tech leaders working in underrepresented communities, experts said.These are long-standing inequities, and there have been people working on these issues for years at a grassroots level. We need to give them a moment to drive the change, said Kistein Monkhouse, founder and chief executive officer of digital health startup Patient Orator, which aims to improve health care outcomes through storytelling.There is evidence that some companies are taking steps toward making their work more inclusive and accessible. Verilys Covid-19 testing program includes a collaboration with the California Coronavirus Testing Task Force and Team Rubicon thats aimed at increasing testing in underserved areas.READ MORE: Fitbits and other wearables may not accurately track heart rates in people of colorEmployees from Google including Google Health, meanwhile, are involved in an effort to map U.S. health disparities with the Morehouse School of Medicine. And in 2018, Google Brain researchers published a study on machine learning and health equity aimed at helping clinicians and policymakers address some of the issues that Adamson highlighted.Still, in a more recent example of the work the companies have ahead of them, Verily recently suspended spot bonuses for employees, opting instead to funnel that money toward social justice initiatives. Some staffers were displeased with the change, first reported by Business Insider, noting in a letter to management that the move implies that these efforts are charity causes not worthy of their own investment.For their health efforts to be truly inclusive, tech companies will need to acknowledge the role systemic racism has played in health care, invest in health tech efforts designed at addressing disparities, and include people from underrepresented groups in their own ranks and in the design and rollout of their products.If tech is about making the world a better place, you cant do that selectively, Adamson said.This article was published by STAT News on July 7, 2020.

Some vaccines use common methods to confer immunity, while others are entirely experimental — theyve never before been approved for use.No matter the approach, academic, corporate and government research teams around the globe are coordinating with national and international agencies to move their candidates through preclinical animal trials and, for those with promising results, human trials. All of them aim to one day see millions, even billions, of doses of their vaccine manufactured and distributed to those in need — hopefully, sooner rather than later.But leading public health officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci have warned there is simply no guarantee that the ongoing national research effort will produce a successful vaccine in 12 to 18 months — a timetable hes repeatedly laid out.Dr. Anthony Fauci has warned there is no guarantee that the ongoing national research effort will produce a successful vaccine in 12 to 18 months.In testimony last week, Fauci, one of the leading members of the White Houses coronavirus task force, emphasized the unpredictable nature of vaccine development, while adding that hes hopeful that a number of doses will be approved and available for distribution by the beginning of 2021.We are cautiously optimistic, looking at animal data and the early preliminary data, that we will at least know the extent of efficacy [for vaccines that go through clinical trials] sometime in the winter and early part of next year, he said before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Vaccines normally go through around a decade of research and evaluation before finally being approved for commercial use. But public health officials have determined that the urgency of the pandemic demands a significantly expedited version of that process.With any potential vaccine, researchers have to ask a series of questions: Does it successfully prompt a desired immune response in humans? Has it been shown to be both safe and effective? Can manufacturing be scaled up to meet the demand required by this crisis?More dilemmas are likely to arise once a vaccine has been approved for use, one of the most crucial being which groups will be first to receive it, and how that decision will be made.Heres a look at some of the top vaccine contenders, as well as the challenges public health officials will face when that vaccine is finally ready for use.How vaccines are developedOne of our immune systems main attributes is that it can remember what viruses look like so that our cells know how to fight them off if they infect us again. When weve been vaccinated against a pathogen or exposed to it naturally, we usually suffer less severe symptoms, or none at all.In the case of coronavirus, which is believed to have just recently evolved to infect humans, its not yet clear if, or for how long, a person who has survived COVID-19 is protected against reinfection. More conclusive antibody research is needed to determine whether those who have already had the virus will need a vaccine, or if those who do get the vaccine will eventually need booster shots as maintenance.Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourUnder normal circumstances, candidate vaccines first go through preclinical trials in which animals like mice or monkeys are inoculated. Researchers then evaluate whether their bodies produced an immune response that would potentially protect against infection in humans, and look for any adverse side effects.After that, successful candidates are eligible to be tested in humans. During the first phase of clinical trials, researchers give the vaccine to a small number of healthy adults to check for safety and immunogenicity, or the vaccines ability to prompt its desired immune response. The second phase of this effort, which involves several hundred volunteers, looks for any unwanted side effects and determines what dose produces the most effective immune response.The third and final phase of vaccine testing continues to evaluate safety and effectiveness by inoculating thousands, even tens of thousands, of volunteers and determines how well the vaccine prevents infection while noting any rare side effects associated with it that didnt become apparent during earlier phases.If all of these steps are successfully completed, researchers can submit their data for review by the Food and Drug Administrations Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. That division is responsible for approving vaccines, overseeing their production and continuing to monitor them once theyre on the market. Only about 6 percent of candidate vaccines are ever approved for commercial use.Only about 6 percent of candidate vaccines are ever approved for commercial use.To identify a promising vaccine for coronavirus, researchers are instead evaluating all of these factors — safety, immunogenicity, efficacy, side effects — in parallel through trials that combine the phases of a typical vaccine development process.During last weeks hearing, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn emphasized the importance of including racial minorities, the elderly, pregnant women and those with other health conditions in large scale human trials to ensure that any vaccine moving through the approval process will be effective on populations most vulnerable to COVID-19. Pregnant people and the elderly or immunocompromised typically arent involved in trials like this, but have been identified as being at greater risk for severe virus outcomes, so researchers must ensure these vaccines protect them.The Defense Department, one of the agencies partnering on the Trump administrations national vaccine development initiative, has said that officials expect to be producing large quantities of vaccines while the clinical trials are still underway, so that there is no delay in manufacturing once safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.Operation Warp Speed is aiming to deliver 300 million doses of a safe, effective vaccine by January 2021, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. In order to do that, billions of federal dollars are being allocated to scale up manufacturing of a handful of promising candidates before theyre actually authorized for distribution. Its a financial risk that most private companies would be loath to take, but a necessary gamble for the government in the context of the pandemic.The ultrastructural morphology exhibited by SARS-CoV-2 is seen in an illustration released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

How vaccines help your body fight off diseaseNovel coronavirus enters the body through the nose or throat, where it begins to infect the cells that line the airway running from our nasal passages all the way down to our lungs, explained Ellen Foxman, an immunobiologist at the Yale School of Medicine. What the virus is just trying to do is make more copies of itself, Foxman said. More virus means it can infect more cells and get transmitted to infect other people, and theres a lot of collateral damage to us.Most vaccines work by prompting the body to create antibodies, or proteins that can bind to specific pathogens and stop them from invading our cells in the first place. Antibodies coat viruses, physically [interfering] with its functions, Foxman said. For novel coronavirus specifically, antibodies could potentially coat the spike protein and prevent it from interacting with [the viral receptors on our cells]. Meet the candidatesAmong the 21 global candidate vaccines currently moving through clinical trials, Operation Warp Speed has begun to single out a handful of contenders by offering them funding, including AstraZeneca, Moderna and Novavax and Johnson & Johnson. The criteria for how those companies were chosen is not fully clear, a concern that lawmakers have pointed out and pushed Trump administration officials for answers. Heres what we do know:AstraZeneca: The vaccine, developed by researchers at the University of Oxford, is a modified adenovirus that mimics the new coronavirus spike proteins, which are what allows the virus to invade human cells. When introduced to the human body, the vaccine aims to prompt the creation of antibodies that would neutralize the actual coronavirus and prevent it from entering an infected persons cells. Phase 3 trials recently kicked off in Britain, Brazil and South Africa.WATCH: Meet people volunteering to be exposed to COVID-19 for vaccine researchLast month, AstraZeneca announced that it had reached an agreement with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi The Vaccine Alliance to support the manufacturing, procurement and distribution of 300 million doses of its vaccine, and that delivery would start by the end of this year. The company also said that it would partner with the Serum Institute of India to supply one billion doses for low and middle-income countries, with a commitment to provide 400 million before the end of 2020.Moderna: This candidate vaccine injects messenger RNA into the body that cells then translate into antigens resembling the coronavirus spike proteins, which intend to prompt the creation of antibodies that would neutralize the new coronavirus if a vaccinated person were to be infected.Vaccines that use messenger RNA to provide immunity have never been approved for human use, but several are being tested to protect against COVID-19. If Modernas makes it to the finish line, itll be the first of its class to do so. A phase 3 study involving 30,000 volunteers is set to begin this month, and Moderna has partnered with the Swiss pharmaceutical company Lonza to manufacture approximately 500 million, but potentially up to 1 billion, doses per year.Part of the appeal of Modernas vaccine is that messenger RNA is easy to make and not very stable — it disintegrates quickly in the body, which means its fairly safe. But that quality could also make an mRNA vaccine difficult to distribute widely. mRNA needs to be stored at around negative 80 degrees Centigrade — a much lower temperature than most other vaccines — which infectious disease expert Paul Offit pointed out would be difficult to accommodate in many settings.Novavax: The biotechnology company announced this week that Operation Warp Speed had pledged $1.6 billion to support late-stage clinical testing of the companys candidate vaccine, which is currently moving through a combined Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Novavax expects to see preliminary results regarding the vaccines safety and immunogenicity by the end of the month.According to Novavax, its vaccine combines recombinant nanoparticle technology to create an antigen derived from the coronavirus spike protein with an adjuvant, or a compound that enhances the bodys immune response.Johnson & Johnson: Johnson & Johnsons candidate vaccine combines genetic material from the coronavirus with a modified adenovirus in order to prompt a protective immune response, according to CNBC News.In June, Johnson & Johnson announced that it expects a combined Phase 1/2a clinical trial of its vaccine involving over 1,000 healthy adults to begin in the U.S. and Belgium later this month. The company said that the trial will evaluate safety, immunogenicity and reactogenicity, or response to vaccination, and that its currently in discussions with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to start a Phase 3 trial, pending the outcome of Phase 1 studies and the approval of regulators.Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organization, recently identified AstraZenecas vaccine as the leading candidate of the vaccines currently undergoing clinical evaluation. She added that Modernas vaccine is not too far behind, and that at least four Chinese companies are preparing to kick off large scale Phase 3 trials for their candidates — one of which was recently approved for military use in China.While those two candidates appear to be among the top contenders, a lot could change between now and the end of this year, let alone by the end of 2021, in the search for a viable coronavirus vaccine.Experts also warn that the first vaccines may not be effective in completely preventing COVID-19 infection.The chair of the United Kingdoms vaccine taskforce, Kate Bingham, has said she expects that the first coronavirus vaccines to prove safe and effective may help alleviate the symptoms of COVID-19, rather than conferring full immunity, The Guardian reported last week.Thats a prediction echoed by Offit, who explained that early vaccines will aim to reduce a persons likelihood of developing moderate to severe disease, but might not protect against reinfection or mild symptoms associated with coronavirus.The goal of this vaccine is going to be to keep you out of the hospital and keep you out of the morgue, Offit said.Who will be first to get the coronavirus vaccine?In order to restore a degree of normalcy to U.S. lives without constant fear of a resurgence, Fauci has said that between 70 to 85 percent of the population will need to be immunized against coronavirus. That will grant the nation herd immunity, which occurs when a large enough portion of a population is immune to a disease that they indirectly protect those who are not immune.Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, estimates that between 5 to 8 percent of the U.S. population has been infected with coronavirus so far. He emphasized during last weeks Senate hearing that it would take several years to achieve herd immunity through natural exposure, hence the urgent need for an effective vaccine.The goal of this vaccine is going to be to keep you out of the hospital and keep you out of the morgue.For many countries, financial challenges may make it difficult to afford the millions or even billions of doses needed to vaccinate their populations. Vaccines need to be kept at a strict temperature range to remain effective, which could make mass distribution a challenge in many parts of the globe given the volume of doses that this crisis demands.Lois Privor-Dumm, director of policy, advocacy and communications at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Healths International Vaccine Access Center, said that the moral question of who to vaccinate first is a difficult one, but that most agree that health care workers are very high priority due to their increased risk of exposure.She emphasized that we must also consider how to make the vaccine available to undocumented people, low-income people, those experiencing homelessness, and other populations that often struggle with health care access. People in these situations, she noted, can be the same ones doing essential work in their communities, putting themselves at greater risk of infection.Another challenge will be ensuring that vaccines are effective in seniors, whose immune systems generally dont respond as efficiently to immunization. Offit said that it will therefore be important to immunize people who frequently interact with elders, such as home health workers and nursing home staff.Maria Elena Bottazzi, associate dean at the Baylor College of Medicines National School of Tropical Medicine and co-director of Texas Childrens Center for Vaccine Development, said that any vaccine thats approved for use will have to meet a series of major requirements. It must induce the correct immune response, and have the best safety profile possible. In order to be distributed widely, it will need to be capable of being manufactured at large scales. She also noted that after a vaccine is developed and brought to market, there are always second [and] third generation iterations that seek to improve upon the original.Once an initial vaccine is launched and licensed, theres a lot of what we call postmarketing surveillance, which eventually leads to better vaccines, Bottazzi explained. Continuing to monitor a vaccine can also reveal any rare negative side effects.Due to cost and manufacturing limitations, she envisions a toolbox of initial vaccines, some of which are more accessible to a wide range of nations, while others may only be available in wealthier countries.Multiple lawmakers have raised concerns about the affordability and availability of an eventual vaccine. Sen. Bernie Sanders pointed out in last weeks hearing with leading health officials that billions of taxpayer dollars are funding pharmaceutical companies in their effort to develop a vaccine. He asked, given the significant of that investment, if every person in the country can expect to have access to an eventual vaccine regardless of their income.All four public health officials present during the hearing — Fauci, Redfield, Hahn, Redfield and Assistant Secretary for Health Adm. Brett Giroir — answered Sanders question affirmatively.Once a vaccine is finally approved, manufactured and available for widespread distribution, the question then becomes whether individuals and families want to be inoculated. A recent poll from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs research found that just 49 percent of people in the U.S. plan to actually get an eventual COVID-19 vaccine.The poll also found that 40 percent of Black people and 23 percent of Hispanic people dont intend to get vaccinated at all. In the case of the Black community, that stance may be in part rooted in general mistrust of the medical establishment. Black Americans have long suffered from lack of access to quality medical care, and even outright abuse at the hands of researchers.But in the context of the pandemic, those numbers are troubling, given that Black and Hispanic individuals, in addition to Native people, are four to five times more likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that long-standing systemic health and social inequities are responsible for putting marginalized people at an increased risk of experiencing severe illness due to the virus, regardless of age.Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourDuring his testimony on Tuesday, Fauci pointed to a community engagement arm of Operation Warp Speed, echoing the concern that a substantial portion of the population, particularly those most at risk for serious disease, will be unwilling to receive the vaccine. He emphasized the need for trusted figures to engage with their communities and help spread accurate information regarding the importance of vaccination, citing the role that kind of outreach played in mitigating the AIDS crisis.We used people in the community — boots on the ground — to go out, who looked and lived and are like the people theyre trying to engage, Fauci said, adding that such local engagement is critical to build the trust that will ultimately save lives.So, while a coronavirus vaccine is still months — possibly years — away, public health officials know that the time now to start building the publics confidence."

When weve been vaccinated against a pathogen or exposed to it naturally, we usually suffer less severe symptoms, or none at all.In the case of coronavirus, which is believed to have just recently evolved to infect humans, its not yet clear if, or for how long, a person who has survived COVID-19 is protected against reinfection. More conclusive antibody research is needed to determine whether those who have already had the virus will need a vaccine, or if those who do get the vaccine will eventually need booster shots as maintenance.Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourUnder normal circumstances, candidate vaccines first go through preclinical trials in which animals like mice or monkeys are inoculated. Researchers then evaluate whether their bodies produced an immune response that would potentially protect against infection in humans, and look for any adverse side effects.After that, successful candidates are eligible to be tested in humans. During the first phase of clinical trials, researchers give the vaccine to a small number of healthy adults to check for safety and immunogenicity, or the vaccines ability to prompt its desired immune response. The second phase of this effort, which involves several hundred volunteers, looks for any unwanted side effects and determines what dose produces the most effective immune response.The third and final phase of vaccine testing continues to evaluate safety and effectiveness by inoculating thousands, even tens of thousands, of volunteers and determines how well the vaccine prevents infection while noting any rare side effects associated with it that didnt become apparent during earlier phases.If all of these steps are successfully completed, researchers can submit their data for review by the Food and Drug Administrations Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. That division is responsible for approving vaccines, overseeing their production and continuing to monitor them once theyre on the market. Only about 6 percent of candidate vaccines are ever approved for commercial use.Only about 6 percent of candidate vaccines are ever approved for commercial use.To identify a promising vaccine for coronavirus, researchers are instead evaluating all of these factors — safety, immunogenicity, efficacy, side effects — in parallel through trials that combine the phases of a typical vaccine development process.During last weeks hearing, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn emphasized the importance of including racial minorities, the elderly, pregnant women and those with other health conditions in large scale human trials to ensure that any vaccine moving through the approval process will be effective on populations most vulnerable to COVID-19. Pregnant people and the elderly or immunocompromised typically arent involved in trials like this, but have been identified as being at greater risk for severe virus outcomes, so researchers must ensure these vaccines protect them.The Defense Department, one of the agencies partnering on the Trump administrations national vaccine development initiative, has said that officials expect to be producing large quantities of vaccines while the clinical trials are still underway, so that there is no delay in manufacturing once safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.Operation Warp Speed is aiming to deliver 300 million doses of a safe, effective vaccine by January 2021, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. In order to do that, billions of federal dollars are being allocated to scale up manufacturing of a handful of promising candidates before theyre actually authorized for distribution. Its a financial risk that most private companies would be loath to take, but a necessary gamble for the government in the context of the pandemic.The ultrastructural morphology exhibited by SARS-CoV-2 is seen in an illustration released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

How vaccines help your body fight off diseaseNovel coronavirus enters the body through the nose or throat, where it begins to infect the cells that line the airway running from our nasal passages all the way down to our lungs, explained Ellen Foxman, an immunobiologist at the Yale School of Medicine. What the virus is just trying to do is make more copies of itself, Foxman said. More virus means it can infect more cells and get transmitted to infect other people, and theres a lot of collateral damage to us.Most vaccines work by prompting the body to create antibodies, or proteins that can bind to specific pathogens and stop them from invading our cells in the first place. Antibodies coat viruses, physically [interfering] with its functions, Foxman said. For novel coronavirus specifically, antibodies could potentially coat the spike protein and prevent it from interacting with [the viral receptors on our cells]. Meet the candidatesAmong the 21 global candidate vaccines currently moving through clinical trials, Operation Warp Speed has begun to single out a handful of contenders by offering them funding, including AstraZeneca, Moderna and Novavax and Johnson & Johnson. The criteria for how those companies were chosen is not fully clear, a concern that lawmakers have pointed out and pushed Trump administration officials for answers. Heres what we do know:AstraZeneca: The vaccine, developed by researchers at the University of Oxford, is a modified adenovirus that mimics the new coronavirus spike proteins, which are what allows the virus to invade human cells. When introduced to the human body, the vaccine aims to prompt the creation of antibodies that would neutralize the actual coronavirus and prevent it from entering an infected persons cells. Phase 3 trials recently kicked off in Britain, Brazil and South Africa.WATCH: Meet people volunteering to be exposed to COVID-19 for vaccine researchLast month, AstraZeneca announced that it had reached an agreement with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi The Vaccine Alliance to support the manufacturing, procurement and distribution of 300 million doses of its vaccine, and that delivery would start by the end of this year. The company also said that it would partner with the Serum Institute of India to supply one billion doses for low and middle-income countries, with a commitment to provide 400 million before the end of 2020.Moderna: This candidate vaccine injects messenger RNA into the body that cells then translate into antigens resembling the coronavirus spike proteins, which intend to prompt the creation of antibodies that would neutralize the new coronavirus if a vaccinated person were to be infected.Vaccines that use messenger RNA to provide immunity have never been approved for human use, but several are being tested to protect against COVID-19. If Modernas makes it to the finish line, itll be the first of its class to do so. A phase 3 study involving 30,000 volunteers is set to begin this month, and Moderna has partnered with the Swiss pharmaceutical company Lonza to manufacture approximately 500 million, but potentially up to 1 billion, doses per year.Part of the appeal of Modernas vaccine is that messenger RNA is easy to make and not very stable — it disintegrates quickly in the body, which means its fairly safe. But that quality could also make an mRNA vaccine difficult to distribute widely. mRNA needs to be stored at around negative 80 degrees Centigrade — a much lower temperature than most other vaccines — which infectious disease expert Paul Offit pointed out would be difficult to accommodate in many settings.Novavax: The biotechnology company announced this week that Operation Warp Speed had pledged $1.6 billion to support late-stage clinical testing of the companys candidate vaccine, which is currently moving through a combined Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Novavax expects to see preliminary results regarding the vaccines safety and immunogenicity by the end of the month.According to Novavax, its vaccine combines recombinant nanoparticle technology to create an antigen derived from the coronavirus spike protein with an adjuvant, or a compound that enhances the bodys immune response.Johnson & Johnson: Johnson & Johnsons candidate vaccine combines genetic material from the coronavirus with a modified adenovirus in order to prompt a protective immune response, according to CNBC News.In June, Johnson & Johnson announced that it expects a combined Phase 1/2a clinical trial of its vaccine involving over 1,000 healthy adults to begin in the U.S. and Belgium later this month. The company said that the trial will evaluate safety, immunogenicity and reactogenicity, or response to vaccination, and that its currently in discussions with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to start a Phase 3 trial, pending the outcome of Phase 1 studies and the approval of regulators.Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organization, recently identified AstraZenecas vaccine as the leading candidate of the vaccines currently undergoing clinical evaluation. She added that Modernas vaccine is not too far behind, and that at least four Chinese companies are preparing to kick off large scale Phase 3 trials for their candidates — one of which was recently approved for military use in China.While those two candidates appear to be among the top contenders, a lot could change between now and the end of this year, let alone by the end of 2021, in the search for a viable coronavirus vaccine.Experts also warn that the first vaccines may not be effective in completely preventing COVID-19 infection.The chair of the United Kingdoms vaccine taskforce, Kate Bingham, has said she expects that the first coronavirus vaccines to prove safe and effective may help alleviate the symptoms of COVID-19, rather than conferring full immunity, The Guardian reported last week.Thats a prediction echoed by Offit, who explained that early vaccines will aim to reduce a persons likelihood of developing moderate to severe disease, but might not protect against reinfection or mild symptoms associated with coronavirus.The goal of this vaccine is going to be to keep you out of the hospital and keep you out of the morgue, Offit said.Who will be first to get the coronavirus vaccine?In order to restore a degree of normalcy to U.S. lives without constant fear of a resurgence, Fauci has said that between 70 to 85 percent of the population will need to be immunized against coronavirus. That will grant the nation herd immunity, which occurs when a large enough portion of a population is immune to a disease that they indirectly protect those who are not immune.Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, estimates that between 5 to 8 percent of the U.S. population has been infected with coronavirus so far. He emphasized during last weeks Senate hearing that it would take several years to achieve herd immunity through natural exposure, hence the urgent need for an effective vaccine.The goal of this vaccine is going to be to keep you out of the hospital and keep you out of the morgue.For many countries, financial challenges may make it difficult to afford the millions or even billions of doses needed to vaccinate their populations. Vaccines need to be kept at a strict temperature range to remain effective, which could make mass distribution a challenge in many parts of the globe given the volume of doses that this crisis demands.Lois Privor-Dumm, director of policy, advocacy and communications at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Healths International Vaccine Access Center, said that the moral question of who to vaccinate first is a difficult one, but that most agree that health care workers are very high priority due to their increased risk of exposure.She emphasized that we must also consider how to make the vaccine available to undocumented people, low-income people, those experiencing homelessness, and other populations that often struggle with health care access. People in these situations, she noted, can be the same ones doing essential work in their communities, putting themselves at greater risk of infection.Another challenge will be ensuring that vaccines are effective in seniors, whose immune systems generally dont respond as efficiently to immunization. Offit said that it will therefore be important to immunize people who frequently interact with elders, such as home health workers and nursing home staff.Maria Elena Bottazzi, associate dean at the Baylor College of Medicines National School of Tropical Medicine and co-director of Texas Childrens Center for Vaccine Development, said that any vaccine thats approved for use will have to meet a series of major requirements. It must induce the correct immune response, and have the best safety profile possible. In order to be distributed widely, it will need to be capable of being manufactured at large scales. She also noted that after a vaccine is developed and brought to market, there are always second [and] third generation iterations that seek to improve upon the original.Once an initial vaccine is launched and licensed, theres a lot of what we call postmarketing surveillance, which eventually leads to better vaccines, Bottazzi explained. Continuing to monitor a vaccine can also reveal any rare negative side effects.Due to cost and manufacturing limitations, she envisions a toolbox of initial vaccines, some of which are more accessible to a wide range of nations, while others may only be available in wealthier countries.Multiple lawmakers have raised concerns about the affordability and availability of an eventual vaccine. Sen. Bernie Sanders pointed out in last weeks hearing with leading health officials that billions of taxpayer dollars are funding pharmaceutical companies in their effort to develop a vaccine. He asked, given the significant of that investment, if every person in the country can expect to have access to an eventual vaccine regardless of their income.All four public health officials present during the hearing — Fauci, Redfield, Hahn, Redfield and Assistant Secretary for Health Adm. Brett Giroir — answered Sanders question affirmatively.Once a vaccine is finally approved, manufactured and available for widespread distribution, the question then becomes whether individuals and families want to be inoculated. A recent poll from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs research found that just 49 percent of people in the U.S. plan to actually get an eventual COVID-19 vaccine.The poll also found that 40 percent of Black people and 23 percent of Hispanic people dont intend to get vaccinated at all. In the case of the Black community, that stance may be in part rooted in general mistrust of the medical establishment. Black Americans have long suffered from lack of access to quality medical care, and even outright abuse at the hands of researchers.But in the context of the pandemic, those numbers are troubling, given that Black and Hispanic individuals, in addition to Native people, are four to five times more likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that long-standing systemic health and social inequities are responsible for putting marginalized people at an increased risk of experiencing severe illness due to the virus, regardless of age.Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourDuring his testimony on Tuesday, Fauci pointed to a community engagement arm of Operation Warp Speed, echoing the concern that a substantial portion of the population, particularly those most at risk for serious disease, will be unwilling to receive the vaccine. He emphasized the need for trusted figures to engage with their communities and help spread accurate information regarding the importance of vaccination, citing the role that kind of outreach played in mitigating the AIDS crisis.We used people in the community — boots on the ground — to go out, who looked and lived and are like the people theyre trying to engage, Fauci said, adding that such local engagement is critical to build the trust that will ultimately save lives.So, while a coronavirus vaccine is still months — possibly years — away, public health officials know that the time now to start building the publics confidence."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/strike-for-black-lives-to-highlight-systemic-racism-ap-report-finds,"Strike for Black Lives to highlight systemic racism, AP report finds",Aaron Morrison,"['Jul 8, 2020']","NEW YORK (AP) — A national coalition of labor unions, along with racial and social justice organizations, will stage a mass walkout from work this month, as part of an ongoing reckoning on systemic racism and police brutality in the U.S.Dubbed the Strike for Black Lives, tens of thousands of fast food, ride-share, nursing home and airport workers in more than 25 cities are expected to walk off the job July 20 for about eight minutes — the amount of time prosecutors say a white Minneapolis police officer held his knee on the neck of George Floyd in May — in remembrance of Black men and women who died recently at the hands of police.The national strike will also include a handful of worker-led marches through participating cities, organizers said Wednesday.According to details shared exclusively with The Associated Press, organizers are demanding sweeping action by corporations and government to confront systemic racism in an economy that chokes off economic mobility and career opportunities for many Black and Hispanic workers, who make up a disproportionate number of those earning less than a living wage. They also stress the need for guaranteed sick pay, affordable health care coverage and better safety measures for low-wage workers who never had the option of working from home during the coronavirus pandemic.READ MORE: Pandemic stress pushes front-line workers toward labor actionWe have to link these fights in a new and deeper way than ever before, said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which represents over 2 million workers in the U.S. and Canada.Our members have been on a journey … to understanding why we cannot win economic justice without racial justice. This strike for Black lives is a way to take our members understanding about that into the streets, Henry told the AP.Among the strikers specific demands are that corporations and government declare unequivocally that Black lives matter. Elected officials at every level must use executive and legislative power to pass laws that guarantee people of all races can thrive, according to a list of demands. Employers must also raise wages and allow workers to unionize to negotiate better health care, sick leave and child care support.The service workers union has partnered with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the American Federation of Teachers, United Farm Workers and the Fight for $15 and a Union, which was launched in 2012 by American fast food workers to push for a higher minimum wage.Social and racial justice groups taking part include March On, the Center for Popular Democracy, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of over 150 organizations that make up the Black Lives Matter movement.Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, a strike organizer with the Movement for Black Lives, said corporate giants that have come out in support of the BLM movement amid nationwide protests over police brutality have also profited from racial injustice and inequity.They claim to support Black lives, but their business model functions by exploiting Black labor — passing off pennies as living wages and pretending to be shocked when COVID-19 sickens those Black people who make up their essential workers, said Henderson, co-executive director of Tennessee-based Highlander Research and Education Center.Corporate power is a threat to racial justice, and the only way to usher in a new economy is by tackling those forces that arent fully committed to dismantling racism, she said in a statement.Trece Andrews, a Black nursing home worker for a Ciena Healthcare-managed retirement home in the Detroit area, said she feels dejected after years of being passed over for promotions. The 49-year-old believes racial discrimination plays a part in her career stagnation.Ive got 20 years in the game and Im only at $15.81 (per hour), she said in a phone interview.As the single mother of a 13-year-old daughter and caregiver to her father, a cancer survivor, Andrews said inadequate personal protective gear makes her afraid of bringing the coronavirus home from her job.Weve got the coronavirus going on, plus weve got this thing with racism going on, Andrews said. Theyre tied together, like some type of segregation, like we didnt have our ancestors and Martin Luther King fighting against these types of things. Its still alive out here, and its time for somebody to be held accountable. Its time to take action.The strike continues a decades-old labor rights movement tradition. Most notably, organizers have drawn inspiration from the Memphis sanitation workers strike over low wages, benefits disparity between Black and white employees, and inhumane working conditions that contributed to the deaths of two Black workers in 1968. At the end of that two-month strike, some 1,300 mostly Black sanitation workers bargained collectively for better wages.Strike for Black Lives organizers say they want to disrupt a multi-generational cycle of poverty perpetuated by anti-union and other policies that make it difficult to bargain collectively for better wages and working conditions.Systemic poverty affects 140 million people in the U.S, with 62 million people working for less than a living wage, according to the Poor Peoples Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival, a strike partnering organization. An estimated 54% of Black workers and 63% of Hispanic workers fall into that category, compared to 37% of white workers and 40% of Asian American workers, the group said.READ MORE: Little evidence that protests spread coronavirus in U.S.The reason why, on July 20th, youre going to see strikes and protests and the walk-offs and socially distanced sit-ins and voter registration outreach is because thousands and thousands of poor, low-wage workers of every race, creed and color understand that racial, economic, health care, immigration, climate and other justice fights are all connected, the Rev. William Barber II, co-chair of the Poor Peoples Campaign, said in a telephone interview.If in fact we are going to take on police violence that kills, then certainly we have to take on economic violence that also kills, he said.Organizers said some striking workers will do more than walk off the job on July 20. In Missouri, participants will rally at a McDonalds in Ferguson, a key landmark in the protest movement sparked by the death of Michael Brown, a Black teenager who was killed by police in 2014. The strikers will then march to a memorial site located on the spot where Brown was shot and killed.In Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed on May 25, nursing home workers will participate in a caravan that will include a stop at the airport. Theyll be joined by wheelchair attendants and cabin cleaners demanding a $15-per-hour minimum wage, organizers said.Angely Rodriguez Lambert, a 26-year-old McDonalds worker in Oakland, California, and leader in the Fight for $15 and a Union, said she and several co-workers tested positive for COVID-19 after employees werent initially provided proper protective equipment. As an immigrant from Honduras, Lambert said she also understands the Black communitys urgent fight against police brutality.Our message is that were all human and we should be treated like humans — were demanding justice for Black and Latino lives, she told the AP.Were taking action because words are no longer bringing the results that we need, she said. Now is the moment to see changes."

The transcripts for the body camera videos of officers Thomas Lane and J. Kueng provide the most detailed account yet of what happened as police were taking Floyd into custody on May 25, and reveal more of what was said after Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed, was put on the ground. READ MORE: Minneapolis officers quit in wake of George Floyd protestsYoure going to kill me, man, Floyd said, according to a transcript of Lanes body camera video.Then stop talking, stop yelling. It takes a heck of a lot of oxygen to talk, said Derek Chauvin, the white officer who held his knee to Floyds neck for nearly eight minutes, even after Floyd stopped moving.Theyll kill me. Theyll kill me. I cant breathe. I cant breathe, Floyd said. Chauvins attorney, Eric Nelson, had no immediate comment Wednesday.The transcripts were made public Wednesday as part of Lanes request to have the case against him dismissed. Lanes attorney, Earl Gray, said in a memorandum that there isnt probable cause to charge his client, based on all of the evidence and the law.Gray painted an image of a rookie officer who trusted Chauvin, a senior officer, after Floyd had been acting erratically, struggling and hurting himself during an arrest. Gray said that once Floyd was on the ground, Lane had asked twice if officers should roll Floyd on his side, and Chauvin said no.Gray also submitted the body camera footage itself, but that was not immediately made public. The transcripts show Floyd appearing cooperative at times but becoming agitated as he begged not to be put in a squad car, saying repeatedly he was claustrophobic.Oh man, God dont leave me man, please man, please man, he begged, later adding: Ill do anything yll tell me to, man. … Im just claustrophobic, thats it.Gray wrote that Floyd started to thrash back and forth and was hitting his face on the glass in the squad and began to bleed from his mouth. Officers brought Floyd to the ground and, the plan was to restrain him so he couldnt move and hurt himself anymore, Gray wrote. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Lane, Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter. Lane was holding Floyds legs at the time, Kueng was at Floyds midsection and Thao was watching nearby bystanders. All four officers were fired.A message left with an attorney for Floyds family want immediately returned. A spokesman for the attorney generals office said prosecutors plan to oppose the motion to dismiss.As part of his court filing, Gray also submitted a transcript of Lanes interview with state investigators and police department training materials on restraint holds. Gray wrote that all of the evidence exonerates his client and that it is not fair or reasonable for Lane to stand trial. Gray said in a memorandum that his clients body camera video shows the encounter with Floyd from the time Lane got on the scene to the point where Floyd was put into an ambulance; Lane went in the ambulance and helped with CPR, according to the transcript. Lane repeatedly told Floyd to show his hands, and he told investigators he drew his gun at first because Floyd was reaching for something, but holstered it once Floyd showed his hands. Body camera video transcripts show Floyd initially said he had been shot before, and begged police not to shoot him.WATCH: On Capitol Hill, George Floyds brother appeals for changes to policingGray said Floyd was acting erratically and had foam at his mouth. According to the body camera video transcripts, when asked about the foam and whether he was on something, Floyd said he was scared and had been playing basketball. As officers struggled to get Floyd into the squad car, Floyd said: I cant breathe and I want to lay on the ground, the transcripts say.Once Floyd was on the ground, Lane told the other officers hes got to be on something, and he asked twice whether officers should roll Floyd onto his side — Chauvin said no. Lane had no basis to believe Chauvin was wrong in making that decision, Gray wrote. Bystanders told officers repeatedly to check Floyds pulse, and after Kueng did he said, I cant find one. Huh? Chauvin said, according to the transcript of Keungs body camera video.Lane told state investigators that Chauvin was not Lanes field training officer, but that he had trained Kueng and was someone Lane had previously gone to for guidance. According to a transcript of that interview, one investigator said it seemed like Lanes gut was telling him something wasnt right with the way Floyd was being restrained. Yeah. I would say felt like it maybe could have been handled differently or we should be reassessing what were doing, I think is what I was kind of coming to, Lane said. Gray argued in his memorandum that in order to charge Lane with aiding and abetting, prosecutors must show Lane played a knowing role in committing a crime. He said theres no evidence Lane played an intentional role or knew Chauvin was committing a crime, namely assault. The decision to restrain Floyd was reasonably justified, Gray wrote, adding: Based on Floyds actions up to this point, the officers had no idea what he would do next – hurt himself, hurt the officers, flee, or anything else, but he was not cooperating.Gray wrote that Lanes trust in Chauvin was reasonable and not criminal."

Deutsche Bank has been one of the few banks willing to lend to Trump after a series of corporate bankruptcies and defaults starting in the early 1990s.Vance and the House Oversight and Reform Committee sought records from Mazars concerning Trump and his businesses based on payments that Trumps former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, arranged to keep two women from airing their claims of decade-old extramarital affairs with Trump during the 2016 presidential race."

Col. Alexander Vindman, a national security aide who played a central role in President Donald Trumps impeachment case, announced his retirement from the Army on Wednesday in a scathing statement that accused the president of running a campaign of bullying, intimidation, and retaliation.The statement from attorney David Pressman said Vindman was leaving the Army after more than 21 years after it had been made clear that his future within the institution he has dutifully served will forever be limited.Through a campaign of bullying, intimidation, and retaliation, the President of the United States attempted to force LTC Vindman to choose: Between adhering to the law or pleasing a President. Between honoring his oath or protecting his career. Between protecting his promotion or the promotion of his fellow soldiers, read the statement, first obtained by CNN.Vindmans name was on a promotion list sent to Defense Secretary Mark Esper earlier this year, according to one U.S. official familiar with the matter. But that list was delayed for weeks because the White House asked for an investigation of Vindman. The Pentagon did a review and found that any suggestion of misconduct was unfounded.The official said the list was resent to Esper about a month ago, but again was delayed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.READ MORE: Mary Trumps book offers scathing portrayal of presidentAnother official said Esper signed the promotion list this week, with Vindmans name included. That list was expected to be sent to the White House by the end of the week, according to the defense official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an internal personnel matter.Its not clear whether Esper already knew of Vindmans plan to retire before he signed the list. The U.S. official said there was talk more than a week ago that he was planning to put in his retirement papers.Pressman said Vindman did what the law compelled him to do; and for that he was bullied by the President and his proxies.LTC Vindmans patriotism, he said, has cost him his career. Today our country loses a devoted soldier, but it is incumbent upon all of us to ensure it does not lose the values he represents.The White House and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Trump in February ousted Vindman from his job on the National Security Council, where he served as an expert on Ukraine, just two days after the presidents acquittal by the Senate. Vindmans lawyer said then that his client had been told to leave in retaliation for telling the truth.Vindmans twin brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, was also asked to leave his job as a White House lawyer. Both men were reassigned to the Army.Vindman had testified that he didnt think it was proper for Trump to demand that a foreign government investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his sons work for the energy company Burisma in Ukraine. And he told impeachment investigators that he twice raised concerns over the administrations push to have Ukraine investigate the Bidens.In the aftermath, senior Pentagon leaders insisted that Vindman would not see any retaliation as a result of the testimony. Talking to reporters in November, Esper said the department has protections for whistleblowers.Vindman shouldnt have any fear of retaliation. Thats DODs position, Esper said, adding that he flatly rejected suggestions that the soldiers career was over. He said he had spoken with Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy about the matter.McCarthy said in February that Vindman was not under investigation, and that he was serving in a Army headquarters job and would go on to senior service college in the summer.In gripping testimony, Vindman also spoke of his familys story and his father bringing them to the U.S. from the Soviet Union when he was a young child.Dad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol, talking to our elected officials, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to United States of America in search of a better life for our family, he testified. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.The lieutenant colonel, who served in Iraq and later as a diplomat, wore his uniform full of medals, including a Purple Heart.When a soldier requests retirement, it must be approved by the Armys Human Resources Command, and normally can take months to process before the person actually leaves the military.AP National Security Writer Robert Burns contributed to this report."

A massive search operation is underway for him. Police officers said they are looking for Mayor Park Won-soon at a small hill in Seouls Sungbuk neighborhood where his mobile phone signal was last detected. They said Parks mobile phone was currently turned off.READ MORE: North and South Korean troops exchange fire along borderHis daughter called police on Thursday afternoon and said her father left a will-like message before leaving their home 4-5 hours earlier. The daughter didnt explain the contents of the message, said one of the officers at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency who is responsible for Parks search operation. The daughter said she decided to call police because she couldnt reach her father on the phone, the officer said, requesting anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to media on the matter.About 150 officers, a drone and a police dog have have been mobilized for Parks search, according to police.Kim Ji-hyeong, an official from the Seoul Metropolitan Government, confirmed that Park did not show up for work on Thursday because of unspecified reasons and canceled all his schedules, including a meeting with a presidential official at his Seoul City Hall office.A longtime civic activist and human rights lawyer, Park was elected as Seoul mayor in 2011 and became the citys first mayor to be voted into a third term in June last year. A member of President Moon Jae-ins liberal Democratic Party, Park has been considered a potential presidential hopeful for the liberals in the 2022 elections.Park has mostly maintained his activist colors as mayor, criticizing what he described as the countrys growing social and economic inequalities and the traditionally corrupt ties between large businesses and politicians. During the earlier part of his terms, Park established himself as a fierce opponent of former conservative President Park Geun-hye and openly supported the millions of people who flooded the city streets in late 2016 and 2017, calling for her ouster over a corruption scandal.Park Geun-hye was formally removed from office in March 2017 and is currently serving a decades-long prison term on bribery and other charges. Seoul, a city with 10 million people, has been a new epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea since the Asian country eased its rigid social distancing rules in early May. Authorities are struggling to trace contacts amid surges in cases linked to nightclubs, church services, a huge e-commerce warehouse and door-to-door sellers. "

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2020-daily-trail-markers-jacksonvilles-covid-count-rises-in-weeks-before-gop-convention/,2020 Daily Trail Markers: Jacksonville's COVID count rises in weeks before GOP convention,['Caitlin Conant'],"['July 8, 2020']","When the Republican National Committee announced in mid-June that it had chosen Jacksonville to host President Trump's nomination acceptance speech, Duval County, where Jacksonville is located, had about 1,900 reported COVID-19 cases. Just over three weeks later, Jacksonville — as well as the state of Florida — is seeing record numbers of positive COVID-19 cases, and Duval County has surpassed 10,000 cases as the state has reopened and testing capacity has increased. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was among the first to announce his state would reopen amid concerns from experts who questioned whether it was too soon, and polls showing the public, too, harbored mixed feelings about reopening. Still, in June DeSantis said Florida could potentially host the convention, assuming that mitigation measures like face masks and testing would be in place. Now, with less than 50 days until the headliner event, Jacksonville has enacted a mandatory mask requirement, Florida is under a statewide executive order prohibiting facilities from operating at more than 50% capacity, and the Sunshine State now has had more than 200,000 COVID cases, the third most of any state, behind California and New York.This week, President Trump told Gray Television's Greta Van Susteren that the details surrounding the convention are ""flexible."" Convention officials have announced that attendees will be tested and have their temperatures checked daily. CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson and campaign reporters LaCrai Mitchell and Nicole Sganga report on the changing landscape in Jacksonville and throughout the state of Florida with less than two months until the event.FROM THE CANDIDATESGet Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxJOE BIDENIn a 110-page document, the Joe Biden-Bernie Sanders task forces released their recommendations on six major topics to nominee Biden and the Democratic National Committee, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. Biden welcomed the months of work from six task forces which were made up of moderates and progressives. ""I commend the Task Forces for their service and helping build a bold, transformative platform for our party and for our country,"" Biden said in a statement specifically thanking Sanders for his leadership. Sanders said Biden and he have ""strong disagreements"" but noted the ""end result"" of the recommendations document is ""a good policy blueprint that will move this country in a much-needed progressive direction"" even though he noted the final document ""is not what I or my supporters would have written alone.""Trail Markers                2020 Daily Trail Markers: GOP convention city's COVID count rises                              2020 Daily Trail Markers: Democratic Senate candidates raise serious cash                              2020 Daily Trail Markers: Trump campaign schedules next rally to be outdoors                              Daily Trail Markers: Trump, Biden spar over jobs report as cases spike                              Daily Trail Markers: Wisconsin court won't expedite voter purge case                          More in Trail Markers            The six areas covered by the document cover climate change, criminal justice reform, economy, education, health care, and immigration. Though the Biden campaign is releasing these recommendations, Biden has not committed to each recommendation, but he is expected to adopt some of these ideas. The CBS News political unit notes the document hews to Biden's advocacy of a healthcare public option, rather than ""Medicare for All."" It favors using federal money to ""create a civilian corps of unarmed first responders"" to ""handle nonviolent emergencies"" so police officers can focus on more dangerous calls. On climate change, the document contained a few timeline goals: By no later than 2050, the U.S. should achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, eliminate carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 and by 2030, net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings. On the economy, the document recommends that Biden pledge no cuts to Social Security benefits or changes to the retirement age, and on immigration, there is a recommendation for a ""100-day moratorium"" on deportations, pending a review of current practices under the Trump administration. The task force's recommendations on education mostly match Biden's previously released plans, but the group highly recommends Biden work for more unionizing for educators.Also on Wednesday, Biden was endorsed by Medicare-for-All activist Ady Barkan, who has ALS and formerly supported Elizabeth Warren and then Bernie Sanders. Explaining his public option health plan to Barkan, Biden suggested he would be able to ""quickly"" pass this plan, whatever the legislative realities are after the election. On police reform, Biden agreed with Barkan that ""absolutely"" a portion of police budgets could be redirected for different programs. Broadly, Biden opposes the total defunding of the police some of his fellow Democrats support. Later in the day, Biden also addressed the IBEW union, ridiculing Presidet Trump's displeasure with COVID-19 testing and general lack of interest in the death rate from the virus.At a virtual fundraiser Tuesday evening Biden came to the defense of Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who has drawn criticism from both President Trump's campaign and Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Referring to her military service, Biden called questions about Duckworth's patriotism ""disgusting"" and ""sickening."" His campaign is currently vetting Duckworth as a potential running mate. He's expected to announce his pick in early August.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMPPresident Donald Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa ""more than likely contributed"" to a spike in new coronavirus cases, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said Wednesday during a press conference. ""We do have the highest number of cases. And we've had some significant cases these few past weeks that more than likely contributed to that,"" Dr. Dart said, referencing Tulsa County. ""We've seen almost 500 new cases, and we had several large events just over two weeks ago, which is about right."" Dr. Dart added that health officials are now left to ""just connect the dots."" CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga and CBS News digital politics reporter Grace Segers report Tulsa's surge in coronavirus cases has outpaced all other cities in Oklahoma, including the more populous Oklahoma City. Tulsa County reported a one-day record high of 261 new cases on Monday, as well as 206 new cases, Tuesday. ""The President's rally was 18 days ago, all attendees had their temperature checked, everyone was provided a mask, and there was plenty of hand sanitizer available for all,"" Trump communications director Tim Murtaugh said, in part, in a statement to CBS News. ""It's obvious that the media's concern about large gatherings begins and ends with Trump rallies."" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Wednesday she did not have data from Tulsa, Oklahoma, adding, ""It's the decision of individuals whether to go. We encourage the wearing of masks."" The Trump campaign will encourage, but not require, mask-wearing at the president's upcoming rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The president's reelection team will also mandate that all campaign staff wear masks inside the rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Saturday night. In a press conference, Tuesday, Governor Sununu told reporters, ""We hear from the Trump campaign that they'll be there wearing masks."" Multiple GOP sources confirmed the Trump campaign staff requirement to CBS News. ""All campaign staff are instructed to wear masks and were in Tulsa as well,"" director of press communications Erin Perrine told CBS News.VEEPSTAKESTAMMY DUCKWORTHVoteVets, a liberal veterans' group, released a video this morning defending Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth after Fox News host Tucker Carlson's comments smearing the senator. CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman says the organization has released videos encouraging presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden to select Duckworth as his running mate. The video features footage of Carlson as the narrator says, ""[President Donald Trump] sicced Tucker Carlson in a suicide mission to take her down"" and that Duckworth is ""tough as hell."" Duckworth also released a statement on Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman's retirement. Duckworth announced her intention last week to block the promotions of 1,123 senior U.S. Armed Forces officials until Defense Secretary Mark Esper gave her written confirmation that he will not block the ""expected and deserved promotion of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman to Colonel."" In a statement Duckworth said, ""Secretary Esper's failure to protect his troops sets a new, dark precedent that any Commander in Chief can interfere with routine merit-based military promotions to carry out personal vendettas and retaliation against military officers who follow duly-authorized subpoenas while upholding their oath of office and core principles of service."" Vindman was a witness and testified in the impeachment trial of Mr. Trump.ISSUES THAT MATTEREDUCATIONThe American Federation of Teachers (AFT) launched a $1 million TV and digital ad buy Wednesday, calling on the Senate to return and pass more funding for schools to reopen safely in the fall. AFT said schools need at least $116.5 billion to accommodate PPE, cleaning supplies, hybrid distance learning, transportation and other aspects of a fall reopening. ""Why are Senate Republicans taking a vacation instead of passing funding to safely reopen schools and kick start our economy?"" the ad asks. ""We can't afford for our children's education to be another victim of the coronavirus. Tell your senator to come back to Washington and support emergency education funding."" CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro says the ads will be running for two weeks on CNN, MSNBC and Fox News in D.C. and 10 states: Arizona,  Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Maine, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  STATE-BY-STATECALIFORNIAAll of California's Democratic state legislators announced today their support of 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, reports CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. The 29 Democratic state senators and 61 assembly members represent more than 28 million Californians and make up more than two-thirds of the state legislature. The Biden campaign called the move an ""unprecedented show of support"" and said it is the first time that members of both houses of the California legislature have come together in a joint show of support for a Presidential candidate."" State Senate President Pro Tempore Toni G. Atkins said senate Democrats in California ""fall all along the political spectrum,"" and underscored the group's strong belief in Biden. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon echoed those remarks, saying in a statement that ""with President Joe Biden there is daylight visible, and an opportunity for unity, recovery and new growth.""NORTH CAROLINANorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper has ordered that all flags at state facilities be lowered to half-staff in remembrance of the late former State Senator Katie G. Dorsett, who was the first Black woman to hold a cabinet position in the state's legislature. Dr. Dorsett passed away Tuesday. ""Katie Dorsett was a dedicated public servant and inspiration as the first African American woman to hold a cabinet position in North Carolina,"" said Cooper in a tweet Tuesday. ""Her work in the state senate and Department of Administration paved the way for future leaders, and she'll be deeply missed."" Born in Mississippi, CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell says Dorsett spent much of her adult life in North Carolina where she taught at North Carolina A&T for more than three decades before going on to serve as a Guilford county commissioner and later the secretary of the North Carolina Department of Administration, making her the first Black woman to serve in a cabinet post in the state's history. Even before this milestone, Dorsett had made history when she became the first Black woman to serve on the Greensboro City Council. From 2003-2010, Dorsett served in the North Carolina Senate and in 2010, she was inducted into the state's Women's Hall of Fame. State flags will remain at half-staff in her honor through Friday.CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGEIN THE HOUSENEW JERSEYEducator Amy Kennedy and former construction CEO David Richter were the most notable winners in New Jersey's House primaries Tuesday, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. In the 2nd District, Kennedy, who is married to former Congressman Patrick Kennedy, a scion of the American political dynasty, quickly cruised through her Democratic primary and will face off against Republican Congressman Jeff Van Drew, who switched parties after flipping the seat in 2018. Mr. Trump won this South Jersey district by five points in 2016. An internal poll by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee showed Kennedy trailing Van Drew by 3 points, and Biden trailing by 1 point to Mr. Trump in the district. The poll was conducted from June 30 to July 3. In the 3rd District, Richter beat former Burlington county legislator Katie Gibbs and is the Republican nominee who will run against Democratic incumbent Andy Kim. While Kim's seat has been targeted by national Republicans, he's been able to keep a consistent fundraising streak and has $3.5 million cash on hand. In an election night statement, Richter said while he expects to be outspent in the general, he called Kim ""a Nancy Pelosi puppet, part of the radical left and a terrible fit for our district, one that voted for President Trump in 2016 and is going to do so again in 2020."" Another notable result, Democrat Josh Gottheimer easily fended off his progressive challenger, local councilwoman Arati Kreibich. Kreibich received late support from Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. She said in her concession statement she'd be voting for Gottheimer.IN THE SENATEHeading into the summer, Democratic Senate hopefuls are raising record amounts of cash in their bids to unseat Republican Senate incumbents, CBS News political unit associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice and Eleanor Watson report. The massive fundraising hauls are pouring in despite the ongoing economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. According to Amy McGrath's campaign, the retired fighter pilot raised $17.4 million from April through June in her primary bid to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. The average donation was $39. This comes just after McGrath eked out a win in the June 23rd primary in a closer than expected race against Charles Booker.  Cook Political Report currently ranks the race as ""likely Republican.""While second-quarter numbers have not yet been filed, the Kentucky Senate race is already one of the most expensive Senate races in the 2020 cycle so far. For context, the Texas Senate race was one of the most expensive Senate contests of 2018. In the second quarter of that year, then Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke brought in just over $10 million in his bid against Senator Ted Cruz. McGrath's fundraising number is also more than was raised by multiple presidential candidates during the 2019 fundraising quarters, including the amount raised by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden during the fall quarter. According to Kantar/Campaign Analysis Group tracking, McGrath has spent $15 million on advertising in her race to date.Meanwhile, in another ranked ""likely Republican,"" Democratic Senate candidate Jaime Harrison in South Carolina has raised almost $14 million in his bid against Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. While Graham has not yet released his second-quarter fundraising number, Harrison raised nearly double what he raised during the first quarter of the year, when he broke South Carolina fundraising records and outraised the incumbent senator. Democratic candidates in more competitive races have continued their run of impressive fundraising since the start of the year.Read more here.GEORGIASenator David Perdue of Georgia released his first two television ads of the cycle on Wednesday, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. In the first ad called ""City on the Hill,"" Perdue said, ""It's up to us to protect what the rest of the world envies: economic opportunity for everybody, limited government, individual liberty."" In the second ad, Perdue said there is a need for police reform but not ""Defund the Police."" He cites measures like body cameras, de-escalation training, and recruiting so that officers look more like the communities they serve. Perdue is taking on Democrat Jon Ossoff in November."

Not opening their wallet was part of a larger effort aimed at highlighting how the Black dollar powers the U.S. economy and how America would be a very different place if Black consumers aren't participating. Black athletes and celebrities – including singer Rihanna, Cleveland Cavaliers center Tristan Thompson and rapper Cardi B – have used social media to bring wider attention to Blackout Day in recent weeks. Rapper T.I. said via Instagram that there should be ""one day of solidarity in America when not one Black person in America spends a dollar.""The Blackout Day movement is in its infancy and it hasn't caught on with every Black American. Although some African-Americans didn't spend money on July 7, others instead patronized Black-owned businesses — and some likely ignored the call altogether. Either way, the day has its roots in trying to emphasize what Black people have contributed, and continue to contribute, to businesses nationwide.  Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxWhat is Blackout Day?Blackout Day is when Black Americans are asked to not spend money — or only with a Black-owned business if necessary. The phrase Blackout Day first surfaced in 2015 on Tumblr as an effort to showcase Black artists and creators and combat negative stereotypes Black people have endured. Then, this May, a Texas resident named Calvin Martyr morphed the phrase Blackout Day into an economic boycott. The Blackout Day effort has gained steam following the deaths of George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks and Breonna Taylor at the hands of police as well as the murder of Ahmaud Arbery. #BLACKOUTDAY2020 ❗️❗️❗️July, 7th 2020❗️❗️❗️ pic.twitter.com/vQNzoMdoso— Calvin Martyr (@thecalvinmartyr) May 12, 2020What issue does Blackout Day spotlight? Black Americans and their spending are becoming an ever larger slice of the U.S. economy, especially spending on consumer goods, ranging from shoes to cell phone services. African-American buying power surpassed $1 trillion in 2016 and is expected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2021, according to the University of Georgia. That makes Black Americans the largest racial consumer market.

Adidas recently acknowledged that point, tweeting its success ""would be nothing without Black athletes, Black artists, Black employees and Black consumers."" Martyr told a Houston television station that Black Americans refusing to buy things for one day will show the nation how important Black spending has become.

Facebook groups dedicated to minority entrepreneurs are another way to find black-owned businesses. People who live in largely White rural areas should know that major metropolitan areas have a higher concentration of Black businesses that include restaurants, catering services, interior designers, law firms, daycare centers and clothing boutiques. Many of them can ship their goods anywhere via their websites or can provide their services to anyone with a Zoom app or FaceTime function.Anyone looking to help Black businesses can also donate to a crowdfunding site, can bank with Black-owned lending institutions, can leave positive reviews of a Black business on their websites or can simply encourage their friends to also buy Black. If you have to spend money today, please support black owned businesses.  Here are just a few in the 7th District.  #BlackLivesMatter #BlackMoneyMatters #Blackout2020 pic.twitter.com/lCBkwwJ3vq— Emanuel Chris Welch (@RepChrisWelch) July 7, 2020Can White people participate in Blackout Day?Absolutely. Black businesses (some of which have already closed for good due to the coronavirus pandemic) will welcome customers from other ethnic groups. White Americans can also donate to, invest in or publicly promote Black businesses.Still, Blackout Day was about redirecting Black dollars toward businesses and efforts that benefit the Black community. The goal is to remind the nation that where Black Americans spend their money can make or break a company — or even an entire economy."

""This is something that's been mustering for a while,"" says Mr Billups.Not for the first time has anger against law enforcement in America spilt out into demands for change - national attempts to reform the country's patchwork of nearly 18,000 police departments have periodically cropped up since the early 20th Century.But outrage over a spate of deaths of black Americans at the hands of police, especially the death of George Floyd, a former club bouncer asphyxiated during an arrest, has spurred a clear bout of soul-searching within police departments themselves.Officers are divided over if and how reforms should come about. For Mr Billups, now chairman of the Grand Council of Guardians, an organisation for African-American law enforcement officers in New York state, the problems lie at the top.'Old-school thinking' A policy of tough policing put forward in the 1980s, the so-called ""broken windows"" theory, has long been destructive for relations between minorities and law enforcement, Mr Billups says.Image copyrightEast Bay Times via Getty ImagesImage caption                    Richmond, California police officers stand with anti-racism protesters                Only recently have authorities begun to step away from more draconian principles, but Mr Billups thinks that a belief in the efficacy of tough tactics persists among the mostly white, and long-entrenched, leadership of many police departments. ""The head is the thinker. The body's going to conform to the head. If the head is not healthy, the body's not going to gain weight.""You gotta change the top,"" says Mr Billups. ""It's a large number of [people who believe in] old-school policing that's still running a lot of these agencies, and the old-school way of thinking just doesn't work no more.""Black officers have always known and felt differently, says Terence Hopkins of the Dallas police department. ""We happen to be African-American people before we were law enforcement,"" he says, ""so that gives us a different view as opposed to our white counterparts.""What's changed since George Floyd's death?Surveys bear this out. A 2016 poll of nearly 8,000 US police oficers by the Pew Research think tank found that 69% of black officers believed that the country needed to ""continue making changes to give blacks equal rights with whites"", compared to just 6% of white officers.The survey, taken in the aftermath of another spate of fatal encounters between police and African-Americans, found that a majority of white and Latino officers believed such events were isolated incidents.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionEric Garner's death inspires an unlikely police experimentBy contrast, 57% of black officers said they were signs of a broader problem with policing.Polls of police in the wake of the recent fatal encounters have yet to emerge, but anecdotally, more officers today seem to agree that the problem goes beyond individuals and needs a systematic approach.White as well as black officers have supported the protests and have publicly called for reforms. Change v status quo""What's happening now is a movement for police reform in our country,"" says Mr Hopkins, who has been a police officer for 30 years.Officer to be fired over Breonna Taylor shootingTimeline of US police killingsSome of the ideas that have become popular in the larger cultural conversation, such as diverting money and duties to fund mental health and social work, he agrees with wholeheartedly, he says. More must be done to recruit minority officers. In Dallas, there is a conscious policy to make the force reflect the demographics of the city it serves. But Mr Hopkins says he also understands why there is resistance to change.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionAntonio Smith is suing the city of Valdosta, Georgia, and its police department over a violent wrongful arrest""You tend to be protective of your industry.

You have one faction that's saying there's a need for change, and then you have another faction in these departments that want to keep it as status quo.""Image copyrightBoston Globe via Getty ImagesImage caption                    Some police have joined protesters in taking a knee in commemoration of George Floyd                Some officers have expressed anger over the backlash on policing and calls to defund or disband departments (though these are not always calls to abolish police, as some have taken them to mean). A viral video circulated in recent weeks of members of the New York Benevolent Association, seen as a traditionally more conservative union for rank-and-file officers, venting at perceived mistreatment of police amid the protests.""Stop treating us like 'animals' and 'thugs',"" Mike O'Meara, head of the union, tells reporters. ""I am not Derek Chauvin. They are not him,"" he said referring to the police officer who killed George Floyd in Minneapolis.""Everybody's trying to shame us. The legislators. The press. Everybody's trying to shame us into being embarrassed of our profession,"" he says. ""We've been left out of the conversation. We've been vilified. It's disgusting.""On Facebook, Blue Lives Matter - a counter group to Black Lives Matter that advocates for police interest - has over 2.2m endorsers.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionWhat happened when a city disbanded its police forceSupporters say police deserve sympathy for doing a difficult job, and that ""radical"" proposals to disband departments would lead to anarchy and lawlessness. Indeed, such reforms can have mixed results. Camden, a working-class town in New Jersey, has been hailed as a model for success after disbanding its troubled police force in 2013, redirecting energies to neighbourhood patrolling. However, in Vallejo, California, outside San Francisco, fatal encounters with police rose dramatically in the years after it disbanded force, in 2008. ""It's just really tough,"" says Robert McCormick, a retired police and parole officer. ""Everybody wants a simple answer, but there isn't one.""There are many complexities even with reforms that sound reasonable, he points out. For example, getting mental health specialists to deal with issues police are not equipped to deal with - a large chunk of calls Mr McCormick, 72, saw in his decades on the job in the Midwest and Colorado - would seem prudent. But officers would have no way of knowing when they answer an emergency ""911"" call that mental illness is the issue at hand. Police kill Canadian man during mental health checkDon't shoot, I'm disabled - how to stop deaths involving policeWith nearly one in three Americans owning a gun, risks for officers can be high. Rather than reducing funds, Mr McCormick thinks, there should be supplemental funds for training and alternative resources for police. Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Protesters call for spending on police departments to be cut                He thinks protections for police do need to remain in place, such as preserving ""qualified immunity"" - another concept that has come under pressure amid the recent protests. The doctrine shields officers from being held personally liable for violating the constitutional rights of people they arrest. Critics argue that this thwarts attempts to hold officers accountable, but Mr McCormick says it is necessary to protect police who are trying to do their jobs. ""It says you can't sue me just for arresting you, just for doing my job,"" he says. ""[The police] are being attacked,"" he says. ""But [on the other hand], it's so damned hard to get rid of a cop who's bad or not doing his job… it's pretty damn near impossible to convict a cop. That's ridiculous.""Ultimately, it will be changes that take place within departments themselves that affect long-term results, thinks the Grand Council's Mr Billups. ""The key thing now is that there's changes in the department,"" he says. ""You're talking about officers who are black or Latino. They go back to those same neighbourhoods where they're policing. [So] a lot of the young black officers see it a different way.""But more importantly, he says, it is that police departments as a whole need to ""learn a new language"" to evaluate the purpose and priorities of the job. ""Departments need to evolve to the 21st Century"". Cops Need a New CodeJeremiah Johnson serves as a police sergeant in Connecticut and holds an appointment as a Practitioner in Residence at the University of New HavenIt took several days before I could bring myself to watch George Floyd's life agonisingly extinguished beneath the unyielding knee of a Minneapolis police officer. As a sworn police officer, I believe it is my duty to watch and not look away; George Floyd's humanity demands it. His unconscionable death laid bare the deficiencies of American policing, a reality which resonated with cities and communities across the nation. Viral images and video clips documenting protests against racism and brutality have done little to disconfirm that the police are racist and brutal. Calls to re-imagine, defund, or even abolish the institution of policing are amplified through these encounters. A friend from my undergraduate days recently lamented on Facebook that she did not know how to explain the police to her children. Rhetorical or not, I inquired whether she meant ""police as they are"" or ""police as they should be?"" Policing is a social institution with an uncertain mandate and mismatched expectations invariably leads to conflict. Reductionist phrases such as ""to serve and protect"" are of little help as they are ambiguous and easily co-opted. The field of policing desperately needs to do some soul-searching and reconsider what it stands for professionally. Rewriting its code of ethics is a good place to start.The current Law Enforcement Code of Ethics is a product of the mid-20th Century's professional era of policing. It was formally adopted by the International Association of Chiefs of Police in 1957. The document is more than symbolic; many police organisations (including the Minneapolis Police Department) have incorporated the Code of Ethics into their policy manuals and oath of office ceremonies. Police reform often takes place in a patchwork fashion. Changing the Code of Ethics would be unprecedented and wide-reaching. To draft a new Code of Ethics worthy of a democratic society, policing should turn to Hippocrates.Medicine's Hippocratic Oath is commonly summarised as ""do no harm"". It is the physician's job to examine the patient, diagnose the medical condition underlying presenting symptoms, and prescribe an effective course of treatment. A doctor who only attends to visible symptoms, provides ineffective medicine, or treats in a manner that is ultimately harmful has failed the patient. By these standards, American policing may be guilty of malpractice. A police code of ethics designed around the Hippocratic Oath should incorporate four key themes that are noticeably absent from the present document: evidence-based policing; crime prevention; professional identity; and the sanctity of life.;In the decades following the code's inception, a vast body of scientific evidence has emerged regarding what works in policing and, perhaps more importantly, what does not. This is not an abstract intellectual issue since police interventions directly impact the lives of community members. Ignoring the evidence base in favour of tradition or personal opinion is more than irresponsible; unscientific policing is unethical policing.  Second, the Code of Ethics is a product of the crime-control era and is singularly focused on enforcement. The desire to apprehend is dominant in American policing's DNA, yet this orientation must give way to crime prevention. It is the absence of crime and disorder that policing should seek to achieve.  Third, the Code of Ethics must repudiate the ideology of the ""thin blue line"". It must clearly establish that police are first and foremost members of the community, not some separate caste standing in the gap between good and evil.Finally, the Code of Ethics rightly speaks to protecting the weak and innocent while opposing unnecessary force and violence. This does not go far enough. Policing must fundamentally acknowledge the sanctity of life and a duty to protect every person, even individuals who have placed themselves or others in jeopardy. If police must use force, they have an ethical duty to transition and render aid to prevent the loss of life.As George Floyd lay dying, one of the bystanders in the crowd tried to reason with the officers declaring, ""Bro, he's human."" The appeal fell on deaf ears. Hippocrates viewed the art of medicine as something fundamentally connected with the love of humanity. The very fabric of American policing must change before the same can be said about law enforcement. It's time for a new code."
