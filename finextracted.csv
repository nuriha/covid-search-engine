Isabella Gomez Sarmiento/NPR                    On a typical sunny spring afternoon, the outdoor seating of Atlanta's Krog Street Market would usually be packed. But it's not a typical week.  As more and more people practice social distancing and stay inside in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the tables at Krog are completely deserted.   Coronavirus Live Updates PODCAST: Coronavirus DailyMost restaurant booths have large signs indicating they're either closed or only serving food to-go. But there's still people coming in and out, carrying Postmates and GrubHub bags.   ""In the last two hours, I've done about 15 deliveries, which is more than normal,"" says Raymond Neville, who's been driving for Uber Eats for about two years.  He says the number of orders coming in has significantly picked up in the last couple of days, which is why he'll keep working even if it might mean potentially exposing himself to the virus. ""I'm just washing my hands. I have hand sanitizer in the car,"" he says. ""I'm taking my own precautions, but hey — it is what it is.""  About half of all states have placed limitations on restaurants: No dining-in allowed — only take-out, delivery, and the occasional drive-thru. And the list just keeps growing.

On March 17, President Trump spoke with executives from companies such as McDonald's, Domino's and Wendy's to encourage them to close their dining rooms and shift to a to-go model of business for the time being.  That means more people stay at home, but it doesn't mean orders stop rolling.   ""[Business] has picked up,"" says Justin Willis, who also works for Uber Eats. ""The money is definitely more than it normally is."" He says he's not too worried about potential exposure to the virus because he doesn't touch or talk to people when running orders, and he carries his own hand wipes around to disinfect any surfaces he comes in contact with. Uber Eats recently announced it would be providing drivers with sanitization products.  Other drivers coming in and out of restaurants wear gloves and wipe down door handles before touching them. Some people decline to be interviewed for this piece for sanitary reasons.  And some drivers worry that continuing to deliver food will ultimately put their health at risk. Online, campaigns like #PayUp —  a movement on behalf of gig economy workers — are demanding that companies such as Instacart, DoorDash and Grubhub take more precautions to protect their drivers, many of whom can't afford to stop working because of the coronavirus.   The Coronavirus Crisis Empty Grocery Shelves Are Alarming, But They're Not PermanentSo far, there's been some response.  Uber recently updated its sick policy to say it'll provide up to two weeks' financial assistance to drivers who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed in quarantine by public health authorities. Postmates says it's also offering to help with medical expenses for drivers who meet certain requirements.  And across apps, there seems to be a push for customers to choose the ""contactless delivery"" option that asks drivers to leave food outside doors and on front porches. ""I'm not that close to [people] when I hand off the food and go,"" says Stephanie Session as she heads inside Patria Cocina to pick up an order.  She started delivering for Uber Eats last year, but she says that since social distancing became encouraged, the volume of weekday orders is matching that of a busy weekend. And to her, more orders and better tips makes the work worth it.  It's unclear when restaurants will fully reopen. But workers like Session plan to keep delivering as long as orders keep coming in — and there may be more drivers soon.  DoorDash is rolling out a new ""priority access"" program for in-house restaurant employees who would like to start delivering during their unexpected time off.  Back at Krog Street Market, as he carefully loads food into his car, Willis summarizes the situation: ""People still gotta eat."" "

Mark Lennihan/AP                    For an idea of why independent restaurants have long complained about food delivery apps, just ask Anil Bathwal, who owns The Kati Roll Company, a group of New York City restaurants serving Indian street food.  Bathwal relied on a handful of food apps to supplement his dining-in purchases, despite hefty commissions the apps tack on to every sale; he used Grubhub-owned Seamless, Uber Eats, Postmates and other food-ferrying services.  If someone ordered two kati rolls for about $12, the apps took a hefty chunk of that sale: roughly a 17% commission on top of a fee for delivering the food to someone's door. In the end, Bathwal said, that kati roll purchased on the delivery app would net his restaurant about $7. App commissions were more manageable when it represented a smaller segment of overall revenue. But the pandemic changed that.  ""That's the only game right now. There's no other way for people to get business because of the lockdown,"" Bathwal says. ""If it starts becoming 30%, 40%, 50% of your business, it is not incremental business — it is your business.""  With already thin profit margins further diluted by the app fees, Bathwal could not justify keeping his six locations open. He temporarily shuttered all of his restaurants with hopes of reopening, when he can, on a pared-down menu emphasizing items that are the most affordable to make.   The Coronavirus Crisis Uber Woos Grubhub, In A Move Lawmaker Calls 'Pandemic Profiteering' He expects food delivery apps to represent a sizable portion of his sales when he can restart his business, but he is not yet sure whether he will be able to make the numbers work out. In a bid to help struggling restaurants, cities from Seattle to Washington, D.C., are passing caps restricting how much food apps can charge to deliver meals. The food delivery apps have different ways of devising fees, but they tend to be in the range of 20% to 40% of how much a restaurant makes in app-generated revenue.  On Wednesday, New York became the latest city to pass commission limits: third-party delivery services will not be able to charge more than 15% per order, and the tech companies cannot add more than 5% for other fees, like credit card processing and for better placement on the apps.  Councilman Mark Gjonaj, who sponsored the bill, said the food delivery apps have placed some restaurants on life support, but it is not sustainable.  ""Without them, it's an instant death. With them, it's a slow death,"" Gjonaj said in an interview.  Grubhub, which controls two-thirds of New York City's food delivery market, claims the commission ceiling could have an unintended consequence for restaurants.  The Salt Uber's Online-Only Restaurants: The Future, Or The End Of Dining Out?New York's fee cap was passed as an emergency measure and applies for as long as restaurants remain closed and for 90 days after eateries are able to reopen.  ""Any arbitrary cap — regardless of the duration — will lower order volume to locally-owned restaurants, increase costs for small business owners, and raise costs on customers,"" Grubhub spokesman John Collins said in a statement. ""Delivery workers would have fewer work opportunities and lower earnings. We also believe that any cap on fees represents an overstep by local officials and will not withstand a legal challenge."" A spokesperson for Postmates said in a statement that limiting commissions makes it harder to operate and ""kills the whole industry's ability to provide the services restaurants need to stay open during this national emergency."" Lawyer Gregory Frank is skeptical about this reasoning. Frank filed a federal lawsuit in Manhattan last month seeking class-action status accusing Grubhub, Doordash, Postmates and Uber Eats of ripping off both customers and restaurants.  Frank points to a clause in the contracts restaurants and the food delivery apps agree to that prohibits owners from charging delivery customers more than people who dine in, even though delivery costs more.  The Coronavirus Crisis As Restaurants Across The Country Close Their Doors, Deliveries Pick Up""By not forcing those purchasing on apps to bear the whole amount of the fees, instead forcing all menu prices to rise together, in-restaurant diners are effectively subsidizing Grubhub's high rates,"" said Frank, who argues such an arrangement is anti-competitive and illegal. Grubhub and the other food delivery apps have not yet filed legal responses to the complaint. Despite the commissions, PitchBook analyst Asad Hussain notes that none of the major food delivery apps are turning a profit.  ""Capping these fees will present a headwind for these companies. It's going to have an impact on growth, and ultimately some of these costs are going to be passed on to consumers, and that's going to reduce demand for these services,"" said Hussain, who expects the coronavirus to hasten consolidation among the delivery apps.   Business Delivery Only: The Rise Of Restaurants With No Diners As Apps Take OrdersWith or without the food delivery apps, some restaurants that have had revenue wiped out will never come back after the pandemic.  A survey from the National Restaurant Association found that the pandemic has caused 4 in 10 eateries to close, and some will never be able to open again. Bathwal with The Kati Roll Company said one of his top tasks ahead of any reopening is trying to negotiate with his landlords.  ""Landlords have been understanding. Some of them are deferring. Some are giving us a little bit of a rent abatement,"" he says. ""So we're hopeful, but we really don't know what's going to happen."""

John Raoux/AP                    In Florida, where there's a surge of new COVID-19 cases, officials are divided over what to do about it. The state saw 2,783 new cases Tuesday. It was the third time in the past seven days that Florida set a new daily record. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Republican officials, including President Trump, say the rising number of new cases was expected and is mostly the result of increased testing. Florida is now testing more than 200,000 people a week, more than double the number tested weekly in mid-May. But local officials and public health experts are concerned about other statistics that show that the coronavirus is still spreading in Florida. The state's Department of Health reports that the number of people showing up in hospital emergency rooms with symptoms of the flu and COVID-19 is rising. Also worrisome — the percentage of people who are testing positive for the virus is going up.     Coronavirus Live Updates Florida's Rising COVID-19 Numbers: What Do They Mean?In Palm Beach County, health director Alina Alonso says the rising positivity rate is a clear sign that the new cases can't just be attributed to increased testing. Since Palm Beach County began allowing businesses to reopen, Alonso says, the percentage of people testing positive has jumped from 4.9% to 8.9%. ""The fact that these are going up means there's more community spread,"" she says. ""The virus now has food out there. It has people that are out there without masks, without maintaining distancing. So it's infecting more people."" Alonso say the number of people hospitalized for the coronavirus has also gone up in Palm Beach County. ""The numbers are very concerning to the hospitals,"" she says. So far, the number of deaths from COVID-19 has remained low. But Alonso says deaths lag behind new recorded cases by about six weeks. She thinks the number of deaths will also rise. ""We need to be cautious at this time. Wait a little bit until we see whether or not that happens,"" she says. ""If we go forward without waiting to see what is going on ... by the time we get those deaths, it will be too late.""   Palm Beach County currently isn't requiring residents to wear face coverings when in public places. County commissioners are now considering following the lead of Broward and Miami-Dade counties and making face masks mandatory.  The Coronavirus Crisis Fired Florida Data Scientist Launches A Coronavirus Dashboard Of Her OwnIn Tallahassee, DeSantis held a news conference where he responded to concerns about the rising positivity rate. Much of it, he said, is related to outbreaks among farmworkers and people in prison. Among the incidents he highlighted — a watermelon farm near Gainesville where, out of 100 workers tested, 90 were positive. DeSantis said, ""When you have 90 out of 100 test positive, what that does to positivity — that's huge numbers."" Some of the other localized outbreaks among farmworkers, he noted, were in Palm Beach County. DeSantis said there's no reason to consider rolling back the rules allowing businesses to reopen at the moment. He has encouraged the resumption of sports events and attended a NASCAR race in Homestead, Fla., on Sunday with a few hundred other spectators. And he successfully lobbied for Florida to host President Trump's acceptance speech at a Republican National Convention event in Jacksonville. That gathering is expected to draw thousands.  Democrats have become increasingly critical, saying DeSantis is ignoring important data that favor a more cautious response. Florida's top elected Democrat, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, said, ""Refusing to acknowledge the alarming patterns in cases, hospitalizations and positivity is not only arrogant but will cost lives, public health and our economy."""

Cliff Hawkins/Getty Images                    As it struggles to control a rising number of new cases of the coronavirus, Florida took a dramatic step, suspending the consumption of alcohol on the premises at bars statewide. Officials in Texas took a similar step Friday, requiring bars to close at noon and be available only for takeout and delivery. The order in Florida came as the state recorded another spike Friday. The state's Department of Health says 8,942 people tested positive for the coronavirus, the highest total yet, eclipsing the record of 5,508 cases two days ago. Florida set another record with the number of people tested — 71,433, over 13,000 more than the previous high. The percentage of people testing positive was just over 13%. It's another indication that measures to stop the spread of the virus have fallen short in Florida. After weeks of declining numbers, COVID-19 cases began steeply rising two weeks ago. Florida is one of the states that began allowing reopening early, in the beginning of May.  Coronavirus Live Updates Florida Passes 100,000 COVID-19 CasesFor days, as the number of cases rose, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis maintained it was largely because of the increase in testing. He also cited outbreaks among farmworkers and prison populations as factors behind the rising numbers. But over the past week, as the percentage of people testing positive spiked, the governor has cited community spread as a serious problem, citing behavior by people in their 20s and 30s. Over the past week, a number of bars in Florida shut down voluntarily after the coronavirus spread among staff and customers.  Enlarge this image                Florida Gov.

John Raoux/AP                    This week, DeSantis held a news conference with Florida's secretary of business and professional regulation to announce a crackdown on bars and restaurants that aren't following the guidelines. ""If you go in and it's just like mayhem, like Dance Party USA and it's packed to the rafters, DeSantis said, ""that's not just an innocent mistake."" Florida suspended the license of a bar in the Orlando area. Local officials throughout the state also say they're cracking down on businesses that don't follow guidelines requiring face coverings, social distancing and limiting occupancy. And today's step, suspending the consumption of alcohol at bars statewide, is effectively a new shutdown for the businesses that had only recently reopened. It's also an acknowledgment that some parts of Florida's reopening may have come too fast.  Coronavirus Live Updates Florida's Rising COVID-19 Numbers: What Do They Mean?Officials and doctors in Florida say despite the surge in cases, hospital capacity remains good statewide. Doctors say they're seeing younger people now with COVID-19. In some counties, the median age for those testing positive is now younger than 30. At Orlando Health, a large hospital system in central Florida, Dr. Sunil Desai says of the cases they're seeing, ""The acuity is less, a lot less folks using or requiring mechanical ventilation or the severe presentations of COVID.

Joan Mateu/AP                    U.S. travelers won't be among those allowed to visit the European Union when the bloc begins opening its external borders on July 1. EU ambassadors endorsed a list of 15 travel partners on Tuesday, including South Korea, Japan and, with a caveat, China. Those countries were hit early by the pandemic but have been able to bring the coronavirus under control. The EU list requires reciprocal easing of travel bans — and the U.S. currently bars most travelers from European countries. China's inclusion on the travel list is predicated on its removal of EU members from its own travel restrictions. The U.S. was seen as a long shot to make the travel list, which requires that only those countries with epidemiological situations — taking into account both the infection rate and current trends — that are equal to or better than the EU's can send tourists and other nonessential visitors to the open-border region. When the EU began discussing its travel list earlier this month, many U.S. states were seeing a worrying spike in cases — a trend that has only worsened.  As ambassadors at the European Council debated the final list, the U.S. shattered its record for daily new cases, reporting 39,972 new cases on June 26, compared with its previous mark of 36,291 cases, which was set on April 24. They've done it! Border battle over.Citizens from these countries can come to the EU tomorrow: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, S Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay & China when it drops restrictions on EU nationals.— Teri Schultz (@terischultz) June 30, 2020The allowed countries are:  Algeria Australia Canada Georgia Japan Montenegro Morocco New Zealand Rwanda Serbia South Korea Thailand Tunisia Uruguay China (subject to confirmation of reciprocity)  It's up to each EU member state to decide how to implement the list — but the European Council says none of them should unilaterally lift travel restrictions on a ""non-listed"" country. Now that the EU travel list has been released, the bloc plans to revise it on a regular basis, as frequently as every two weeks. For now, the U.S. is excluded along with other countries that are struggling to fight the coronavirus, such as Brazil and Russia. The EU has roughly 116 million more people than the U.S. But the bloc is currently reporting roughly 1.5 million coronavirus cases — far less than the more than 2.6 million cases reported by the U.S. And in a troubling sign of how deeply the coronavirus has taken root in the U.S., the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the official tally is vastly undercounted, with more than 20 million Americans possibly infected. ""Our best estimate right now is that for every case that was reported, there actually were 10 other infections,"" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said last week. As it issued the travel list, the EU also provided more clarity about how it analyzes other countries' coronavirus status. In addition to looking at the number of new cases over the past 14 days, for instance, the European standard calls for a country's case rate per 100,000 inhabitants to be ""close to or below the EU average."" When U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked about the possible exclusion of the U.S. last week, he said discussions are ongoing. ""I am confident that we will find a set of conditions that create sufficient health and safety protections"" and still allow travel, Pompeo said at a press briefing. If no U.S. tourists visit Europe in the coming months, it would deal another financial blow to an already ailing travel and hospitality industry. Last year, roughly 2 million or more Americans visited Europe in each month from May through September, according to the U.S. National Travel & Tourism Office. The pandemic has turned travel into a fraught topic, over fears of the possible spread of the virus. It has also caused tension between the EU and the U.S., particularly after President Trump announced a travel ban on 26 European countries (exempting the United Kingdom) in mid-March. EU officials publicly registered their disapproval, saying they had not been warned about the ban. Days later, the EU began closing its own borders.

On Monday, the state reported almost 6,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19. That's a record, as cases spike following the state's reopening of bars, restaurants and stores in early May. Because of this latest surge, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott recently reversed the reopening, closing bars and cutting restaurant capacity. Houston Methodist Hospital — the flagship hospital of the Houston Methodist system — has enough beds, says Roberta Schwartz, who holds multiple executive positions at the hospital, including chief innovation officer. But that's because she's making room at the expense of other services.  ""If you look within the hospital, what it looks and feels like here right now is that every day I am clearing out another unit and I am putting in COVID patients,"" she says. She says she has seen an uptick in cases at the hospital since just after Memorial Day. Here are excerpts of Schwartz's Morning Edition conversation. On making room for COVID-19 patients So when we were at the point where the volumes of COVID were down, we were able to open up many of our other services. And what we found when we opened up a lot of our services is that many people had waited for a very long time to seek medical care and they were very sick. And so we were able to treat many of those patients both in clinics and in the hospital. ... We kind of looked at each other and said we should never do that again. We should never close down all of our services, because it was detrimental to the health of Houston. It was dangerous for people to wait to seek needed care.   And so what's been very hard is to yesterday send out yet another series of notes closing down services further because we have no choice, because we have to transition units into COVID to take care of the population. So do we have the beds? Yes. Fortunately, at this point, we have not had to put up tents or field hospitals, but each day it's more and more.  On seeing videos and pictures from across Texas of people in bars and not social distancing On one hand, there are so many people who believe that this is not reality, that what you're hearing is made up or false, and I want to take them all and walk them through an ICU to see a husband and wife laying side by side intubated or seeing a 26-year-old with no comorbidities who is laying in a hospital bed for 14 days in an intubated state and say, ""It is very real.""

Eric Gay/AP                    Pennsylvania officials announced Wednesday that residents must wear face coverings when outside the home, the latest in a series of mask mandates in various states to combat the spread of COVID-19.  The Pennsylvania order takes effect immediately and builds on an April directive requiring masks to be worn inside businesses. Gov. Tom Wolf called the expanded measure essential to stopping the recent increase in coronavirus cases reported in the state. ""Those hot spots can be traced to situations where Pennsylvanians were not wearing masks or practicing social distancing — two practices that must be adhered to if we want to maintain the freedoms we have in place under our reopening,"" he said.  Pennsylvania is not the only state to make such an announcement in recent days.   Coronavirus Live Updates Pence Urges Americans To Wear Masks To Stop Spread Of COVID-19On Monday, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown announced that a mandate requiring face coverings in indoor public spaces that previously applied only to certain counties would take effect statewide Wednesday. And in Kansas, masks must be worn in indoor public spaces as well as in outdoor settings where social distancing cannot be maintained, starting Friday.  ""Wearing a mask is not only safe — but it is necessary to avoid another shutdown,"" Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said.  The growing list of states with universal mask mandates includes North Carolina, California, Nevada, Rhode Island, New York, Delaware, Connecticut, New Mexico, Illinois and Washington.  Other states have rules in place requiring people to wear masks in certain situations, such as on public transit or in grocery stores. And in some parts of the country, local governments — such as Phoenix and Jacksonville, Fla. — have enacted mandates of their own.   Official health guidance recommends wearing cloth face coverings to help prevent the spread of respiratory droplets that travel into the air and onto other people as a result of coughing, sneezing or speaking. Research supports the efficacy of masks in controlling the spread of the virus.   ""There's no doubt that wearing masks protects you,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told members of Congress on Tuesday.  Shots - Health News Yes, Wearing Masks Helps. Here's WhyWhile mask usage has been the subject of partisan debate, leading Republicans such as Vice President Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy have been newly vocal in expressing their support for face coverings in recent days. Other officials, such as presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are advocating for a federal mask mandate.  ""When you do not wear your face covering, we end up in a situation where you see higher rates of disease spread and you end up having to close places,"" Surgeon General Jerome Adams said at a public briefing Tuesday. ""This mask, this face covering, actually is an instrument of freedom for Americans if we all use it."" According to new research by Goldman Sachs, a national mask mandate could save nearly 5% of gross domestic product in addition to cutting the daily growth rate of confirmed coronavirus cases to 0.6%.

Octavio Jones/Getty Images                    Updated at 7:43 p.m. ET Florida's surge of COVID-19 cases shows no signs of slowing down. The state Department of Heath reported Florida set another daily record Thursday, with 10,109 cases, surpassing Saturday's record of 9,585 cases. That brings Florida's total confirmed coronavirus cases to nearly 170,000 and a death toll of 3,617 (with 67 new deaths reported Thursday). The new record continues a marked upturn in cases that began last month, weeks after Florida started allowing businesses to reopen. Gov. Ron DeSantis has defended that decision, saying that for most of April and May, the number of new cases and the percentage of those testing positive for the virus remained low. But then, DeSantis said, he believes Floridians became complacent. ""After Memorial Day, when it fell out of the news,"" he said, ""people kind of just thought, it was over.""  Coronavirus Live Updates Florida Smashes Coronavirus Case Record: Nearly 9,000 Positive CasesOn Thursday, he met with Vice President Pence and other federal officials in Tampa. Speaking afterward, Pence thanked DeSantis for his leadership in combating the coronavirus and in reopening Florida's economy. ""It's not an either-or choice,"" Pence said. ""The economic comeback that's underway is a demonstration that we don't have to choose between opening America and the health of our people. We can do both."" DeSantis has resisted calls for a statewide order requiring face coverings for people in public places. As the numbers of COVID-19 cases have risen, many counties and cities have adopted rules making face coverings mandatory.  One of the most recent to do so is Jacksonville, which is set to host President Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in August.  Asked whether it will be safe for people over 65 or with underlying health conditions to attend the convention, Pence didn't answer directly. ""We're excited about coming to Jacksonville,"" he said. ""I was at a meeting not long ago when I heard about very sophisticated plans to make sure it's a safe and healthy environment."" In Tampa, DeSantis was asked if he had any ""personal responsibility"" for the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Florida, while other states such as New York and New Jersey were seeing cases decline. ""Well, do you give credit for Florida for having a much lower fatalities per 100,000 than all the states you just praised?"" DeSantis shot back. ""We have fewer fatalities than some of these states have just in nursing homes.""  At DeSantis' direction, Florida has rolled back part of its reopening, closing all bars in the state last week to all but takeout business. Florida took that action as an increasing number of young people became infected with the virus and several bars closed voluntarily. To avoid encouraging large crowds, local governments in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties have ordered beaches closed through the July Fourth weekend. And on Thursday night, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Giménez announced a countywide daily curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. until further notice. He also rolled back the opening of entertainment facilities such as movie theaters, arcades, casinos, adult entertainment, concert houses and bowling alleys, effective Friday.  ""This curfew is meant to stop people from venturing out and hanging out with friends in groups, which has shown to be spreading the virus rapidly,"" he said.    Coronavirus Live Updates Florida Officials Spar Over Rising COVID-19 CasesDeSantis said he believes these measures are reminding residents they need to be careful. ""Now, people understand, this thing doesn't just go away,"" he said. ""You can do a lot of things if you take some small precautions.""  The rising numbers of coronavirus cases have raised questions about DeSantis' leadership and his close ties to Trump, whom he consulted before allowing businesses to begin reopening.   Democratic U.S. Rep. Donna Shalala, who represents parts of Miami, said, ""In their rush to reopen, they've put politics ahead of public health."" Shalala said DeSantis made a mistake by not acting sooner to shut the state down. ""We needed at the beginning to hit this virus with a hammer, to starve it all the way down,"" she said. ""We didn't do the right thing in the beginning, and now we're trying to play catch-up."""

As cases slow, the curve levels or bends down. In New York, site of the country's largest outbreak, the state's curve rose sharply before reaching over 170,000 total cases in April. Since then, new cases have fallen from about 10,000 per day in mid-April to fewer than 700 per day in late June.   Some states, such as Hawaii, have declined to just a dozen new cases per day, while others are growing. Arizona, which had leveled off at around 15,000 total cases in May, saw a sudden sharp spike in new cases in June.  Loading...  The coronavirus has hit some states much harder than others. For much of the pandemic, a large share of U.S. cases have been centered around New York City. As of early June, New York state, Connecticut and New Jersey accounted for about 30% of total cases in the nation and 42% of deaths, although new cases have been dropping in these three states. Across the country, other large, populous states such as California, Illinois and Texas have high totals as well. Some smaller states have had a heavy burden of disease relative to their population size, such as Nebraska and Iowa, which have high case counts per capita, and Louisiana and Michigan which have a high death count per capita.

Isabella Gomez Sarmiento/NPR                    On a typical sunny spring afternoon, the outdoor seating of Atlanta's Krog Street Market would usually be packed. But it's not a typical week.  As more and more people practice social distancing and stay inside in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the tables at Krog are completely deserted.   Coronavirus Live Updates PODCAST: Coronavirus DailyMost restaurant booths have large signs indicating they're either closed or only serving food to-go. But there's still people coming in and out, carrying Postmates and GrubHub bags.   ""In the last two hours, I've done about 15 deliveries, which is more than normal,"" says Raymond Neville, who's been driving for Uber Eats for about two years.  He says the number of orders coming in has significantly picked up in the last couple of days, which is why he'll keep working even if it might mean potentially exposing himself to the virus. ""I'm just washing my hands. I have hand sanitizer in the car,"" he says. ""I'm taking my own precautions, but hey — it is what it is.""  About half of all states have placed limitations on restaurants: No dining-in allowed — only take-out, delivery, and the occasional drive-thru. And the list just keeps growing.

On March 17, President Trump spoke with executives from companies such as McDonald's, Domino's and Wendy's to encourage them to close their dining rooms and shift to a to-go model of business for the time being.  That means more people stay at home, but it doesn't mean orders stop rolling.   ""[Business] has picked up,"" says Justin Willis, who also works for Uber Eats. ""The money is definitely more than it normally is."" He says he's not too worried about potential exposure to the virus because he doesn't touch or talk to people when running orders, and he carries his own hand wipes around to disinfect any surfaces he comes in contact with. Uber Eats recently announced it would be providing drivers with sanitization products.  Other drivers coming in and out of restaurants wear gloves and wipe down door handles before touching them. Some people decline to be interviewed for this piece for sanitary reasons.  And some drivers worry that continuing to deliver food will ultimately put their health at risk. Online, campaigns like #PayUp —  a movement on behalf of gig economy workers — are demanding that companies such as Instacart, DoorDash and Grubhub take more precautions to protect their drivers, many of whom can't afford to stop working because of the coronavirus.   The Coronavirus Crisis Empty Grocery Shelves Are Alarming, But They're Not PermanentSo far, there's been some response.  Uber recently updated its sick policy to say it'll provide up to two weeks' financial assistance to drivers who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed in quarantine by public health authorities. Postmates says it's also offering to help with medical expenses for drivers who meet certain requirements.  And across apps, there seems to be a push for customers to choose the ""contactless delivery"" option that asks drivers to leave food outside doors and on front porches. ""I'm not that close to [people] when I hand off the food and go,"" says Stephanie Session as she heads inside Patria Cocina to pick up an order.  She started delivering for Uber Eats last year, but she says that since social distancing became encouraged, the volume of weekday orders is matching that of a busy weekend. And to her, more orders and better tips makes the work worth it.  It's unclear when restaurants will fully reopen. But workers like Session plan to keep delivering as long as orders keep coming in — and there may be more drivers soon.  DoorDash is rolling out a new ""priority access"" program for in-house restaurant employees who would like to start delivering during their unexpected time off.  Back at Krog Street Market, as he carefully loads food into his car, Willis summarizes the situation: ""People still gotta eat."" "

Matt York/AP                    With new daily coronavirus cases rising in at least two dozen states, an explosion of new infections in Arizona is stretching some hospitals and alarming public health experts who link the surge in cases to the state's lifting of a stay-at-home order close to a month ago.   Arizona has emerged as one of the country's newest coronavirus hot spots, with the weekly average of daily cases nearly tripling from two weeks ago. The number of people hospitalized is climbing, too. Over the past week, Arizona has seen an average of more than 1,300 new COVID-19 cases each day. After the state's largest hospital system warned about a shortage of intensive care unit beds, Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, pushed back on assertions that the health care system could soon be overwhelmed. ""The entire time we've been focused on a possible worst-case scenario with surge capacity for hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators,"" Ducey told reporters Thursday. ""Those are not needed or necessary right now."" While he acknowledged a spike in positive cases, Ducey said a second stay-at-home order was ""not under discussion.""   ""We put the stay-at-home order there so we could prepare for what we are going through,"" he said.  Some states have reopened more slowly with a set of specific benchmarks for different regions, but Arizona took a more aggressive approach.  The state began easing restrictions on businesses in early May and lifted its statewide lockdown order after May 15. Under Arizona's reopening plan, businesses are advised to follow federal guidance on social distancing.  There is also no requirement for everyone to wear masks in public.   Public health experts agree: The timing of this spike reflects the state's reopening.  ""Perhaps Arizona will be a warning sign to other areas,"" said Katherine Ellingson, an epidemiologist at the University of Arizona. ""We never had that consistent downward trend that would signal it's time to reopen and we have everything in place to do it safely."" Before Arizona lifted its stay-at-home order, about 5% of tests for the coronavirus registered as positive. Two weeks later, that number was around 12%.  A slower reopening gives public health agencies time to identify whether or not cases are rising and then respond with contact tracing and isolating those who are infected.  ""With a fast, rapid reopening, we don't have the time to mobilize those resources,"" Ellingson said.   Shots - Health News Tracking The Pandemic: Are Coronavirus Cases Rising Or Falling In Your State?Maricopa County, home to about 60%  of the state's population, has ramped up contact tracing in recent weeks, but it may not have enough capacity if the surge in cases continues.  Dr. Peter Hotez said the spike in Arizona, as well as parts of Texas such as Houston, Dallas and Austin, is the consequence of removing restrictions too quickly and without a public health system that can keep pace.  ""It was just open it up and then more or less business as usual, with a little bit of window dressing,"" said Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. ""This is not an abstract number of cases. We're seeing people pile into intensive care units."" Arizona's governor has also faced criticism from the mayors of the state's two biggest cities for not putting in place more stringent requirements.  ""There is a pandemic, and it's spreading uncontrollably,"" said Tucson Mayor Regina Romero, a Democrat. Ducey, she said, ""is just putting up his hands and saying, 'The spread is happening, and we just have to go about our business.' "" Adding to Romero's frustration, the governor's executive order forbids local governments from implementing their own extra measures.  ""What he did was pretty much tie the hands of mayors and public health officials,"" Romero said. Phoenix Mayor On Arizona's Alarming Rise In COVID-19 Cases Since Reopening, ProtestsArizona's hospital industry has tried to tamp down fears that it's on the verge of a crisis. Hospitals are still performing elective surgeries. ""It's very unfortunate because hospitals right now in Arizona are quite busy with elective procedures,"" said Saskia Popescu, a Phoenix-based epidemiologist with George Mason University. ""You throw in increasing cases of COVID, and that's going to very much stress your hospital systems.""  Phoenix's triple-digit summer temperatures may help fuel the spread of the virus as well. People forgo outdoor activities and retreat to air-conditioned indoor spaces, where the risk of transmitting the virus goes up significantly. ""My concern is we're going to see a lot more people in close quarters for prolonged periods of time,"" she said.  Since the stay-at-home order was lifted, Popescu and others said they've seen people returning to a pre-pandemic mindset, neglecting to wear masks or maintain social distance. Videos of crowded bars have only propelled these fears.  On Thursday, however, Arizona's top doctor stressed there were also dangers to keeping the state on lockdown, including the mental health effects of loneliness and isolation.   ""We know that it's in the community. We are not going to be able to stop the spread. And so we can't stop living as well,"" said Dr. Cara Christ, health director for the Arizona Department of Health Services.  But Quinn Snyder, an emergency medicine physician in Mesa, Ariz., said there needs to be more consistent messaging on public health measures such as wearing masks.   ""Frankly, I just think a wholesale reevaluation of where we're at is critical right now, but I can tell you that we're not doing nearly enough,"" said Snyder, who has seen the uptick in seriously ill COVID-19 patients firsthand.  ""If we continue to head down this path, the virus will press our health care facilities beyond capacity, where we're going to have to be making tough decisions like who gets a ventilator and who doesn't."""

And so we can't stop living as well,"" said Dr. Cara Christ, health director for the Arizona Department of Health Services.  But Quinn Snyder, an emergency medicine physician in Mesa, Ariz., said there needs to be more consistent messaging on public health measures such as wearing masks.   ""Frankly, I just think a wholesale reevaluation of where we're at is critical right now, but I can tell you that we're not doing nearly enough,"" said Snyder, who has seen the uptick in seriously ill COVID-19 patients firsthand.  ""If we continue to head down this path, the virus will press our health care facilities beyond capacity, where we're going to have to be making tough decisions like who gets a ventilator and who doesn't."""

Gonzalez/Pool/Getty Images                    Updated at 5:50  p.m. ET Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has announced the state will ""pause"" any further reopening of its economy for now, a day after he said that Texas is facing a ""massive outbreak"" of the coronavirus. The state reported a record-high number of new cases on Thursday: 5,996. It's the third day in a row with a record number of new cases. Texas also saw 47 new fatalities, bringing the cumulative number of deaths related to COVID-19 there to 2,296. ""As we experience an increase in both positive COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, we are focused on strategies that slow the spread of this virus while also allowing Texans to continue earning a paycheck to support their families,"" Abbott said in a statement Thursday morning. ""The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses. This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business."" Texas was among the first states to begin the process of reopening, and many businesses are in operation once again. Those businesses that are already permitted to be open may continue to operate under the existing health protocols and capacity restrictions. Bars and restaurants have already opened for indoor seating, and gyms, malls and movie theaters have been allowed to open, too.  Nearly 90,000 Texans filed for unemployment last week, NPR member station KUT reported — about 5,480 ​fewer new claims than the previous week. Abbott also halted elective surgeries in four of the state's largest counties. That move is aimed at expanding hospital capacity as the spike in hospitalizations threatens to overwhelm intensive care units and outstrip available ventilators. His order suspends elective surgeries at hospitals in Bexar, Dallas, Harris and Travis counties — home to the respective cities of San Antonio, Dallas, Houston and Austin. It directs hospitals in those counties to ""postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately, medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition or to preserve the life of a patient who without immediate performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient's physician.""  Abbott said he may add or subtract counties from the list as needs arise.  Shots - Health News Tracking The Pandemic: Are Coronavirus Cases Rising Or Falling In Your State?In San Antonio, ventilator availability dipped below 70% for the first time on Wednesday, Texas Public Radio reported. In Houston, one hospital's ICU reportedly was at 120% capacity, while another one's was at 88%. Texas Medical Center in Houston said Tuesday that 97% of its ICU beds were occupied and that 27% of those patients were people who had tested positive for the coronavirus. It said its normal ICU occupancy is 70% to 80%. On Thursday, the Houston Chronicle reported that the medical center has reached 100% of its ICU capacity. Coronavirus Live Updates Texas Governor Says 'No Reason Today To Be Alarmed' As Coronavirus Cases Set RecordJust nine days ago, Abbott touted the state's ""abundant"" hospital capacity as the  numbers of cases in the state were rising quickly. According to state data, as of Thursday, the Dallas area had 1,137 people hospitalized with COVID-19, Houston had 1,496, San Antonio had 606, and Austin had 288. ""These four counties [Bexar, Dallas, Harris and Travis] have experienced significant increases in people being hospitalized due to COVID-19 and today's action is a precautionary step to help ensure that the hospitals in these counties continue to have ample supply of available beds to treat COVID-19 patients,"" Abbott said in Thursday's statement.  ""As we work to contain this virus, I urge all Texans to do their part to help contain the spread by washing their hands regularly, wearing a mask, and practicing social distancing."""

Greg Abbott is ordering bars to close again and restaurants to reduce seating capacity amid a surge in new coronavirus cases. It's the most significant rollback since the state began reopening.  In an executive order, Abbott restricted bars to delivery and takeout service only starting at noon Friday.  He also mandated restaurants cut back on dine-in service, operating at only 50% capacity, effective Monday. Previously, they had been able to fill dining rooms at 75% of normal occupancy.  Abbott's office said in a statement that the ""targeted, measured"" directives were aimed at businesses linked to a recent statewide rise in new coronavirus cases. ""At this time, it is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including Texans congregating in bars. The actions in this executive order are essential to our mission to swiftly contain this virus and enhance public health,"" Abbott said. Outdoor gatherings of more than 100 people must now have the approval of local officials, and river rafting and tubing businesses were also shut down by the action.   The rollbacks come amid a statewide surge of new coronavirus infections. On Thursday, the state health department reported 5,996 new cases, the third day in a row of record-high new infections in the state.  The rate of positive test results, as of Wednesday, is also approaching 12%.  ""As I said from the start, if the positivity rate rose above 10%, the state of Texas would take further action to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,"" Abbott said. Texas was one of the first states to relax closures on nonessential businesses during the pandemic. Until Friday's rollback, most businesses in the state were able to operate with a capacity of at least 50% capacity.  But as cases and hospitalizations surged this week, Abbott ordered a halt to elective surgeries in four of the state's largest counties and said he was hitting a pause on reopening plans.  On Tuesday, the governor also expanded the influence of local authorities to restrict large gatherings. The same day as Abbott's order, a Harris County judge raised the county's threat level to its highest rating. The county of 4.7 million, which includes Houston, has seen a massive increase in hospitalizations and new cases in recent days.  ""Whichever angle you look at it from, our situation is far worse today than when we issued the first stay-home order in Harris County, and when the state issued their first stay-home order,"" Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said during a press conference, as Houston Public Media reported. Hidalgo said she does not have the legal authority to issue a countywide stay-at-home order, the NPR member station added. She is asking Harris County residents to remain at home, except for essential trips for things such as medical services."

Michael Chow/AP                    In an about-face, Arizona's Gov. Doug Ducey has ordered the state's bars, gyms, movie theaters and water parks to shut down for at least 30 days amid thousands of new coronavirus cases in the state. Ducey issued the order Monday to go into effect from 8 p.m. local time, citing concern over a recent spike in new cases — including a one-day record of more than 3,800 in the state on Sunday. It was the seventh time in the past 10 days that new cases in Arizona exceeded 3,000. He also ordered public schools to delay the start of classes until Aug. 17. ""Our expectation is that our numbers next week will be worse,"" he said, describing the state's coronavirus data as ""brutal."" Most of the state's bars and nightclubs reopened after Ducey's stay-at-home orders expired in mid-May. The original order allowed bars with food service to reopen even earlier than White House guidelines recommended. Under the latest order, the state's Department of Liquor Licenses and Control will suspend special event and festival licenses, although a city or county would be allowed to approve a large gathering, if social distancing and other safety guidelines are followed.  ""Arizonans have been, by and large, terrific, fantastic and responsible,"" the Republican governor said at a news conference Monday afternoon. However, he noted ""the photos and videos of some of the things that were happening around our state this weekend, and the result of that (type of activity) has been an increase in the spread."" Ducey called his new order a ""targeted approach"" intended to ""pump the brakes"" on the pandemic response. Arizona joins Florida and Texas in reimplementing stricter coronavirus controls amid increasing numbers of cases. Vice President Pence is set to travel to Phoenix on Wednesday, where he will meet Ducey to discuss the state's coronavirus response, according to Pence's office. Ducey on Monday described the anticipated July 27 expiration of the order as ""aspirational,"" saying lifting it then would depend on the number of cases and hospitalizations."

Pallavi Gogoi/NPR                    Two days after President Trump instituted a ban on travelers from Europe, our daughter Rhea was on a flight home from Madrid. Her college study abroad program had come to an abrupt end. At the airport, she was surprised and annoyed I wouldn't give her the usual tight hug and kiss. I was awkwardly practicing social distancing with my firstborn. And when we pulled up to our porch, my husband was waiting with a mask and gloves, hand sanitizer, and a disinfecting spray for her luggage. She started laughing incredulously: ""Wait, what?"" Two days later, though, no one was laughing when she started complaining of chills and aches. I thawed a Cornish hen and made my children's favorite soup from scratch. Worry etched our minds as her temperature reached 100 degrees. We knew it was the start of a strict 14-day quarantine.  Our Daily Breather Our Daily Breather: Hanif Abdurraqib On Finding Comfort In BakingMy husband drove her the next day to our local hospital. A nurse came out to the car to take a swab. Three days later, we got a call that Rhea had tested positive for COVID-19. She just turned 20 and is healthy and athletic, but it's still frightening when your child comes down with a disease that has killed nearly 150,000 people. Her symptoms were mild, but we were still scared, given how little people know about the disease. Our family has many advantages and that put us in a good place to nurse her through this. But the quarantined are lonely and my daughter was no exception. None of us could comfort her in person when she had to go into solitary confinement in her room.    The Coronavirus Crisis A Pound Of Flour To Go? Restaurants Are Selling Groceries NowBut all of us — my husband, our son and I — were determined to make it less frightening for Rhea. That meant turning to food. It's how the family bonds. The kids have spent a lot of time in the kitchen. I remember them standing on step stools when they were little, rolling out rotis with their tiny hands on the rolling pin, eagerly watching me as I made them on the fire. They chopped green beans or okra for me. A home-prepared feast has marked many a milestones, be it a birthday or a graduation. In celebrations, we spend days planning and making a vast array of dishes that could include lamb biryani, pulled pork, roast chicken and pasta, all in one meal to accommodate their many desires. And in sickness we turn to soup. So we got started on a menu. After all, for 14 days she would have at least three meals a day plus a snack. Thankfully, my husband and I both love to cook. Below are just a few of Rhea's quarantine meals. It wasn't haute cuisine, but we tried. And more importantly, we tried to keep the mood light.

Small bowls of almond and grapes, served with iced coffee topped with almond milk, all nicely arranged on a tray. My husband stood outside her room and announced: ""Room Service."" She giggled.

We said it whenever we delivered Rhea's tray. After a while she didn't giggle over that. It's hard to be locked in a room alone. Our short chats through her bedroom door became more important. And her phone was a savior. It was her lifeline to the outside world — her friends via Snapchat or FaceTime, or us via text. Evening snacks were a mix of her favorite things — like fruits and nuts. One day it was sliced persimmon, a bowl of pumpkin seeds, with cranberry juice, or olives with hummus and pita bread, another day fresh guacamole with tortilla scoops, and yet another day: dumplings with soy sauce.

Mark Lennihan/AP                    For an idea of why independent restaurants have long complained about food delivery apps, just ask Anil Bathwal, who owns The Kati Roll Company, a group of New York City restaurants serving Indian street food.  Bathwal relied on a handful of food apps to supplement his dining-in purchases, despite hefty commissions the apps tack on to every sale; he used Grubhub-owned Seamless, Uber Eats, Postmates and other food-ferrying services.  If someone ordered two kati rolls for about $12, the apps took a hefty chunk of that sale: roughly a 17% commission on top of a fee for delivering the food to someone's door. In the end, Bathwal said, that kati roll purchased on the delivery app would net his restaurant about $7. App commissions were more manageable when it represented a smaller segment of overall revenue. But the pandemic changed that.  ""That's the only game right now. There's no other way for people to get business because of the lockdown,"" Bathwal says. ""If it starts becoming 30%, 40%, 50% of your business, it is not incremental business — it is your business.""  With already thin profit margins further diluted by the app fees, Bathwal could not justify keeping his six locations open. He temporarily shuttered all of his restaurants with hopes of reopening, when he can, on a pared-down menu emphasizing items that are the most affordable to make.   The Coronavirus Crisis Uber Woos Grubhub, In A Move Lawmaker Calls 'Pandemic Profiteering' He expects food delivery apps to represent a sizable portion of his sales when he can restart his business, but he is not yet sure whether he will be able to make the numbers work out. In a bid to help struggling restaurants, cities from Seattle to Washington, D.C., are passing caps restricting how much food apps can charge to deliver meals. The food delivery apps have different ways of devising fees, but they tend to be in the range of 20% to 40% of how much a restaurant makes in app-generated revenue.  On Wednesday, New York became the latest city to pass commission limits: third-party delivery services will not be able to charge more than 15% per order, and the tech companies cannot add more than 5% for other fees, like credit card processing and for better placement on the apps.  Councilman Mark Gjonaj, who sponsored the bill, said the food delivery apps have placed some restaurants on life support, but it is not sustainable.  ""Without them, it's an instant death. With them, it's a slow death,"" Gjonaj said in an interview.  Grubhub, which controls two-thirds of New York City's food delivery market, claims the commission ceiling could have an unintended consequence for restaurants.  The Salt Uber's Online-Only Restaurants: The Future, Or The End Of Dining Out?New York's fee cap was passed as an emergency measure and applies for as long as restaurants remain closed and for 90 days after eateries are able to reopen.  ""Any arbitrary cap — regardless of the duration — will lower order volume to locally-owned restaurants, increase costs for small business owners, and raise costs on customers,"" Grubhub spokesman John Collins said in a statement. ""Delivery workers would have fewer work opportunities and lower earnings. We also believe that any cap on fees represents an overstep by local officials and will not withstand a legal challenge."" A spokesperson for Postmates said in a statement that limiting commissions makes it harder to operate and ""kills the whole industry's ability to provide the services restaurants need to stay open during this national emergency."" Lawyer Gregory Frank is skeptical about this reasoning. Frank filed a federal lawsuit in Manhattan last month seeking class-action status accusing Grubhub, Doordash, Postmates and Uber Eats of ripping off both customers and restaurants.  Frank points to a clause in the contracts restaurants and the food delivery apps agree to that prohibits owners from charging delivery customers more than people who dine in, even though delivery costs more.  The Coronavirus Crisis As Restaurants Across The Country Close Their Doors, Deliveries Pick Up""By not forcing those purchasing on apps to bear the whole amount of the fees, instead forcing all menu prices to rise together, in-restaurant diners are effectively subsidizing Grubhub's high rates,"" said Frank, who argues such an arrangement is anti-competitive and illegal. Grubhub and the other food delivery apps have not yet filed legal responses to the complaint. Despite the commissions, PitchBook analyst Asad Hussain notes that none of the major food delivery apps are turning a profit.  ""Capping these fees will present a headwind for these companies. It's going to have an impact on growth, and ultimately some of these costs are going to be passed on to consumers, and that's going to reduce demand for these services,"" said Hussain, who expects the coronavirus to hasten consolidation among the delivery apps.   Business Delivery Only: The Rise Of Restaurants With No Diners As Apps Take OrdersWith or without the food delivery apps, some restaurants that have had revenue wiped out will never come back after the pandemic.  A survey from the National Restaurant Association found that the pandemic has caused 4 in 10 eateries to close, and some will never be able to open again. Bathwal with The Kati Roll Company said one of his top tasks ahead of any reopening is trying to negotiate with his landlords.  ""Landlords have been understanding. Some of them are deferring.

""No. I don't think they would do that,"" he says. ""I think [students] would just have the party and then face the repercussions."" That's exactly what Apramay Mishra, student body president at the University of Kansas, is worried about when it comes to reopening campus amid the pandemic. ""Right now it's kind of slipped from most people's minds,"" he says. Students ""don't really think it's a big deal."" Around the U.S., coronavirus cases are rising among young people. The spread of the virus has been connected to college-related events such as fraternity parties, drinking at off-campus bars and athletic practices. For colleges planning to bring thousands of students together in the fall, student spread is a real worry. And the stakes are high: If there are outbreaks, campuses may once again be forced to shut down, scattering students and disrupting academics and college finances all over again.   Shots - Health News Younger Adults Are Increasingly Testing Positive For The CoronavirusTo keep that from happening, schools have created robust guidelines — but those plans rely on a major wild card: students following the rules. ""That's the conversation everyone is having right now,"" says Anna Song, who studies young adult decision-making at the University of California, Merced. Many college students still have developing brains, so it's not that they aren't informed or that they don't understand the risks — it's that they're wired differently. ""They are highly sensitized to reward, especially in the context of peers,"" she explains. Hanging out with friends is a pretty incredible reward, given that many students have been isolated for months. ""Peer culture is ... not easy to change"" Changing campus culture and student behavior isn't just about rewards. Song found that you can influence behavior if you find the right messaging. She studies smoking habits, and she has found that students who believe that their smoking will harm their friend's health are significantly less likely to start smoking themselves. The challenge for colleges is to figure out what messages will motivate students to adhere to the guidelines. Song isn't convinced that the idea of keeping faculty safe will be enough — she says administrators may have to focus on family members or friends who are vulnerable.  The Coronavirus Crisis For In-Person College, Coronavirus Testing Will Be Key. But Is That Feasible?Other experts are less optimistic that student behavior can change. ""Peer culture is really durable. It is not easy to change,"" says Kristen Renn, an associate dean at Michigan State University. ""We haven't done it with alcohol. We haven't done it with sexual behavior. We haven't done it with all kinds of things."" Renn is most worried about the moments outside the classroom: brushing teeth, running into friends, grabbing dinner. And Song is worried about those too. ""I vacillate back and forth, honestly. Day to day,"" she says. ""I am optimistic, but there are some real serious challenges. And we can't be naive that those challenges aren't there. Are we asking them to do something that is almost near impossible?"" The front lines At the University of Miami, Pat Whitely, vice president of student affairs, is responsible for figuring out how to reopen dorms, how to orient new students and how to make sure everyone follows the rules. It hasn't been easy. ""I've done a lot of crisis work in my career,"" she says. ""Different hurricanes and things. This has been the hardest work ever because it's so much of the unknown.""  The Coronavirus Crisis 6 Ways College Might Look Different In The FallWhitely has been telling student leaders how integral they are to the college's reopening plan. ""All of you are more crucial than you've ever been before,"" she told a group of orientation leaders over Zoom this month. ""We have to have everybody cooperate, because if we have an outbreak, then that becomes a problem for everybody."" The university plans to hire student ambassadors to help enforce some of the new health policies, such as mask wearing and social distancing. It's also one of many schools that have drawn up contracts for students coming back to campus, requiring them to follow the new pandemic guidelines. One such agreement, at the University of Pennsylvania, asks students to ""refrain from organizing, hosting, or attending events, parties, or other social gatherings off-campus.""  The Coronavirus Crisis Can Colleges Survive Coronavirus? 'The Math Is Not Pretty'Of course, student agreements aren't new. Nearly every campus in America has a student handbook or code of conduct, explains Martha Compton, president of the Association for Student Conduct Administration. And for the most part, they work. ""The vast majority of students do abide by guidelines, with an even higher level when they're related to classroom conduct,"" Compton says. But it's imperative that colleges educate students on the rules, especially if they've changed. She also advises that colleges enforce the rules with compassion and leniency — for example, having masks available when someone forgets. At the University of Virginia, senior Ellen Yates has been working with a handful of students to figure out what messaging and enforcement should look like on her campus. ""We are concerned about creating a kind of policing culture on grounds where students feel like they're being watched or monitored,"" she says. ""We want to instead work for accountability between students."" Keeping campuses safe will require buy-in from all students, because it's not just an individual decision, like alcohol consumption. COVID-19 is a contagious disease, so peer behavior impacts the entire community. Yates is convinced that the key is to make mask wearing and social distancing the norm. Students will follow the example of their fellow students, she says, particularly students whom they admire and look up to. She thinks of it as a positive peer pressure strategy. But even she has doubts. ""All of our routines are built around social interaction,"" says Yates. ""It's just a totally new set of social conditions that certainly nobody in my age has ever been subjected to."""

He also reported a second record high: 2,518 people hospitalized with the virus in Texas, up from 2,326 a day earlier. Despite the concerning uptick in people sick with the virus, Abbott said that the reason for his news conference was to let Texans know about the ""abundant"" hospital capacity for treating people with COVID-19. He and other officials spent much of the briefing touting the state's hospital bed availability. Disclosing the new record high number of hospitalizations related to COVID-19, Abbott emphasized that figure is ""really a very small percentage of all the beds that are available.""

Greg Abbott (@GovAbbott) June 16, 2020Texas has so far been spared the high case numbers in other populous states. While it's the second-largest state by population, Texas currently ranks sixth in terms of cumulative case numbers. Before releasing the number of new cases, Abbott delved into what he said accounted for the previous daily high on June 10, which had 2,504 new cases. The governor said that spike could be largely attributed to 520 positive tests of inmates in Texas prisons being reported at once as well as a data error in a rural county.   Shots - Health News Coronavirus 2nd Wave? Nope, The U.S. Is Still Stuck In The 1st One Coronavirus Live Updates Texas Reports Record-Breaking COVID-19 Hospitalizations As State ReopensHe said there are also reasons for why Tuesday's new case count was so high: tests results coming from an assisted living facility near Plano; a county south of Austin where positive cases seemed to be reported in batches; and 104 cases in one East Texas county that appear to be primarily from tests at a prison. But he also pointed to uncareful behavior as a possible driver in some of the new cases. Abbott said there were a number of counties where a majority of those who tested positive for the coronavirus were under the age of 30, which he attributed to people going to ""bar-type"" settings or Memorial Day celebrations and not taking health precautions. Abbott said that measures such as wearing masks, hand sanitizing and social distancing are what make it possible to reopen the state's economy. Dr. John Hellerstedt, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, struck the same note. ""The message is we are seeing some increase in the number of COVID patients in the state. We expected this,"" he said. ""But we are seeing it occurring at a manageable level. I really want to stress that the continued success is up to the people of the state of Texas."" Despite Abbott's emphasis on the importance of masks, he has barred Texas cities from implementing any rules that would require face coverings. Abbott signed an executive order on April 27 that says while individuals are encouraged to wear face masks, ""no jurisdiction can impose a civil or criminal penalty for failure to wear a face covering."" On Tuesday, the mayors of nine Texas cities — including Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, Fort Worth and El Paso — sent a letter to the governor asking for the authority to set the rules and regulations on the use of face coverings. ""A one-size-fits-all approach is not the best option. We should trust local officials to make informed choices about health policy. And if mayors are given the opportunity to require face coverings, we believe our cities will be ready to help reduce the spread of this disease,"" they wrote. ""If you do not have plans to mandate face coverings statewide, we ask that you restore the ability for local authorities to enforce the wearing of face coverings in public venues where physical distancing cannot be practiced."" Abbott said Tuesday that judges and local officials have other tools available for enforcement such as issuing fines for gatherings that don't follow state protocols. Austin Mayor Steve Adler extended a stay-at-home warning on Monday amid the news of rising cases – but that warning could only be advice to residents and not an order due to the state's preemption. ""People are confused,"" Adler told NPR's Steve Inskeep on Tuesday. ""They just don't know at this point if it's really important to wear face coverings or not, because I think they're feeling like they're getting mixed messaging — not only from state leadership but from national leadership. So we're just not getting the vigilance that we need on these efforts.""

Adler said he agreed with Abbott that face coverings are key to reopening parts of the economy, even if they're unpleasant for wearers. ""I know it's inconvenient. I know it's hot. I know it's a nuisance,"" Adler said. ""And it's hard to do, and people don't like it. But at the same time, our community has to decide just how much we value the lives of folks in our community that are over 65 and older.

The decision comes just days after Gov. Doug Ducey granted local governments autonomy to establish their own health and safety measures to fight rising COVID-19 cases. Up until then, Ducey had led the state's response to the pandemic which is now in the midst of a surge.  Although he was among the first governors to enact emergency stay-at-home orders, Arizona was part of a wave of states that lifted those restrictions last month. Since then there has been a surge in the number of coronavirus infections, hospitalizations are up, and more people are dying. The Phoenix policy applies to all individuals within the city limits, over the age of 5, ""whenever they are away from their home or residence and within six feet of another person who is not a member of their family or household.""  Additionally, any business whose employees interact with the public must enforce the mandate. Businesses also have the right to refuse service to anyone who doesn't comply with the order.  However, council members included a number of exemptions to the mandate, including people ""whose religious beliefs prevent them from wearing a face covering."" Also, restaurant patrons who are eating or drinking, anyone participating in a team sport or exercising outside while keeping a six foot distance from non-household members can forego face masks.   City officials said enforcement would focus on ""education and information.""  But  NPR member station, KJZZ reported Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Wiliams said that puts her officers in a challenging situation.  Williams said: ""We're going to hand folks a flyer and pretty much turn around and walk away.

Josep Lago/AFP via Getty Images                    The European Union is making a list of countries whose travelers will be allowed to visit this summer — and for now at least, the U.S. doesn't seem likely to meet the criteria based on its recent coronavirus numbers. The United States has the most cases of any country in the world, and many states are reporting sharp rises in new cases as they ease shutdown orders. The EU plans to begin lifting its travel restrictions on July 1 in a move that could salvage part of the summer tourist season. Its member nations are now discussing how to open the bloc to travelers without risking a new outbreak, and the list of preferred countries is a central part of those talks. Chief among the criteria: ""the epidemiological situation in a given country, which should be as good as or better than in the EU,"" a European Commission spokesperson told NPR. As of last week, the notification rate for new coronavirus cases in the EU and the U.K. ""was 82% lower than at the peak on 9 April 2020,"" the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said in its most recent weekly report.  In contrast, the U.S. recently reported more than 32,000 new cases on two consecutive days – something that hadn't happened since April 11, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The European Commission set the framework for a selective list of countries this month when it said all 27 member states should agree to one set of criteria to allow visitors from outside countries. The EU's current goal is to finalize the list before it lifts restrictions in one week. Once the EU travel list is final, the bloc would revise it on a regular basis, to reflect changing circumstances as countries grapple with the pandemic that has now left some 9.3 million people infected worldwide, including more than 2.3 million in the United States. Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, French minister for Europe and foreign affairs, is one of the European officials negotiating the travel list — a process he described on French radio as ""very intense work."" Lemoyne said Europe had mostly gotten the epidemic under control and that France was ready to roll out the welcome mat to other Europeans. But he said the EU could not risk letting visitors in from countries where the virus is still rapidly spreading. The EU checklist for deciding which nations should enjoy relaxed travel restrictions looks at several key factors, from the recent number of new infections to the overall trend in cases. It also takes into account a country's response to the coronavirus through testing, surveillance, contact tracing, containment and treatment. Details about what metrics the EU might use — such as time frames or per capita rates of spread — are not yet known. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he believes the United States and its European allies will be able to work out an arrangement. ""We've been working with them for quite some time on this,"" Pompeo said at a press briefing. ""I am confident that we will find a set of conditions that create sufficient health and safety protections"" and still allow travel. Travel between the U.S. and Europe has been a source of contention during the pandemic. When President Trump abruptly announced a travel ban on 26 European countries (exempting the United Kingdom) about three months ago, the EU publicly registered its disapproval, saying it had not been warned. The U.S. ban also triggered chaos at airports as people scrambled to make last-minute arrangements. The coronavirus has been raging in many parts of the U.S., where several populous states, including Texas, California and Florida, have reported record high numbers of new cases. Over the past 14 days, the U.S. has reported 367,172 new cases — second only to Brazil's 406,403 cases, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In addition to concerns about controlling the coronavirus, the checklist could also wind up barring the U.S. because it calls for a reciprocal relaxing of travel restrictions toward all EU countries. The U.S. currently bars most travelers from European countries. ""It's important for the United States to get Europeans the capacity to travel back to the United States,"" Pompeo said. ""It's very important for the Europeans to fully reconnect with the American economy as well."" The dearth of U.S. visitors to Europe is already dealing a financial blow to the travel and tourism industry. Last year, roughly 2 million or more Americans visited Europe in each month from May through September, according to the U.S. National Travel & Tourism Office.

Doug Ducey has ordered the state's bars, gyms, movie theaters and water parks to shut down for at least 30 days amid thousands of new coronavirus cases in the state. Ducey issued the order Monday to go into effect from 8 p.m. local time, citing concern over a recent spike in new cases — including a one-day record of more than 3,800 in the state on Sunday. It was the seventh time in the past 10 days that new cases in Arizona exceeded 3,000. He also ordered public schools to delay the start of classes until Aug. 17. ""Our expectation is that our numbers next week will be worse,"" he said, describing the state's coronavirus data as ""brutal."" Most of the state's bars and nightclubs reopened after Ducey's stay-at-home orders expired in mid-May. The original order allowed bars with food service to reopen even earlier than White House guidelines recommended. Under the latest order, the state's Department of Liquor Licenses and Control will suspend special event and festival licenses, although a city or county would be allowed to approve a large gathering, if social distancing and other safety guidelines are followed.  ""Arizonans have been, by and large, terrific, fantastic and responsible,"" the Republican governor said at a news conference Monday afternoon. However, he noted ""the photos and videos of some of the things that were happening around our state this weekend, and the result of that (type of activity) has been an increase in the spread."" Ducey called his new order a ""targeted approach"" intended to ""pump the brakes"" on the pandemic response. Arizona joins Florida and Texas in reimplementing stricter coronavirus controls amid increasing numbers of cases. Vice President Pence is set to travel to Phoenix on Wednesday, where he will meet Ducey to discuss the state's coronavirus response, according to Pence's office. Ducey on Monday described the anticipated July 27 expiration of the order as ""aspirational,"" saying lifting it then would depend on the number of cases and hospitalizations."

Joan Mateu/AP                    U.S. travelers won't be among those allowed to visit the European Union when the bloc begins opening its external borders on July 1. EU ambassadors endorsed a list of 15 travel partners on Tuesday, including South Korea, Japan and, with a caveat, China. Those countries were hit early by the pandemic but have been able to bring the coronavirus under control. The EU list requires reciprocal easing of travel bans — and the U.S. currently bars most travelers from European countries. China's inclusion on the travel list is predicated on its removal of EU members from its own travel restrictions. The U.S. was seen as a long shot to make the travel list, which requires that only those countries with epidemiological situations — taking into account both the infection rate and current trends — that are equal to or better than the EU's can send tourists and other nonessential visitors to the open-border region. When the EU began discussing its travel list earlier this month, many U.S. states were seeing a worrying spike in cases — a trend that has only worsened.  As ambassadors at the European Council debated the final list, the U.S. shattered its record for daily new cases, reporting 39,972 new cases on June 26, compared with its previous mark of 36,291 cases, which was set on April 24.

Joan Mateu/AP                    U.S. travelers won't be among those allowed to visit the European Union when the bloc begins opening its external borders on July 1. EU ambassadors endorsed a list of 15 travel partners on Tuesday, including South Korea, Japan and, with a caveat, China. Those countries were hit early by the pandemic but have been able to bring the coronavirus under control. The EU list requires reciprocal easing of travel bans — and the U.S. currently bars most travelers from European countries. China's inclusion on the travel list is predicated on its removal of EU members from its own travel restrictions. The U.S. was seen as a long shot to make the travel list, which requires that only those countries with epidemiological situations — taking into account both the infection rate and current trends — that are equal to or better than the EU's can send tourists and other nonessential visitors to the open-border region. When the EU began discussing its travel list earlier this month, many U.S. states were seeing a worrying spike in cases — a trend that has only worsened.  As ambassadors at the European Council debated the final list, the U.S. shattered its record for daily new cases, reporting 39,972 new cases on June 26, compared with its previous mark of 36,291 cases, which was set on April 24.

Bing Guan/Bloomberg via Getty Images                    Major League Baseball is officially coming back this summer after a delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but aspects of the game will look a little different. MLB announced Monday that it would shift some of its in-game rules, making significant and historic changes. Many of those rule changes were made with concerns over the spread of the coronavirus in mind, including a threat of immediate ejection if a player or coach comes within 6 feet of an umpire or opponent in the course of an argument. There's also a ban on spitting, which many baseball players do conspicuously. Spitting, ""including but not limited to saliva, sunflower seeds or peanut shells, or tobacco,"" is prohibited.  Other measures to limit the spread of the virus include asking pitchers to carry a small wet rag instead of licking their fingers for moisture, ordering teams to provide expanded dugout and bullpen space, and instructing all participants to practice general social distancing. Fielders are also ""encouraged to retreat several steps away"" from the base runner when the ball is out of play.   The league has also tweaked game play rules in other ways, including some that are intended to speed up the game. The National League, which represents half of the MLB's teams, will allow teams to use designated hitters for the first time ever. That means another player can bat in place of the pitcher. The American League has had this rule in place for decades. If a game goes into extra innings, teams will start each half-inning with a runner on second base — a move that will likely lead to more scoring when teams are tied after nine innings. Also, any player may appear as a pitcher at any point in the game. While players will report to their respective training camps Wednesday, the shortened, 60-game regular season is not set to begin until July 23 or 24. Some details still need to be worked out between the Major League Baseball Players Association and MLB."

Octavio Jones/Getty Images                    Updated at 7:43 p.m. ET Florida's surge of COVID-19 cases shows no signs of slowing down. The state Department of Heath reported Florida set another daily record Thursday, with 10,109 cases, surpassing Saturday's record of 9,585 cases. That brings Florida's total confirmed coronavirus cases to nearly 170,000 and a death toll of 3,617 (with 67 new deaths reported Thursday). The new record continues a marked upturn in cases that began last month, weeks after Florida started allowing businesses to reopen. Gov. Ron DeSantis has defended that decision, saying that for most of April and May, the number of new cases and the percentage of those testing positive for the virus remained low. But then, DeSantis said, he believes Floridians became complacent. ""After Memorial Day, when it fell out of the news,"" he said, ""people kind of just thought, it was over.""  Coronavirus Live Updates Florida Smashes Coronavirus Case Record: Nearly 9,000 Positive CasesOn Thursday, he met with Vice President Pence and other federal officials in Tampa. Speaking afterward, Pence thanked DeSantis for his leadership in combating the coronavirus and in reopening Florida's economy. ""It's not an either-or choice,"" Pence said. ""The economic comeback that's underway is a demonstration that we don't have to choose between opening America and the health of our people. We can do both."" DeSantis has resisted calls for a statewide order requiring face coverings for people in public places. As the numbers of COVID-19 cases have risen, many counties and cities have adopted rules making face coverings mandatory.  One of the most recent to do so is Jacksonville, which is set to host President Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in August.  Asked whether it will be safe for people over 65 or with underlying health conditions to attend the convention, Pence didn't answer directly. ""We're excited about coming to Jacksonville,"" he said. ""I was at a meeting not long ago when I heard about very sophisticated plans to make sure it's a safe and healthy environment."" In Tampa, DeSantis was asked if he had any ""personal responsibility"" for the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Florida, while other states such as New York and New Jersey were seeing cases decline. ""Well, do you give credit for Florida for having a much lower fatalities per 100,000 than all the states you just praised?"" DeSantis shot back. ""We have fewer fatalities than some of these states have just in nursing homes.""  At DeSantis' direction, Florida has rolled back part of its reopening, closing all bars in the state last week to all but takeout business. Florida took that action as an increasing number of young people became infected with the virus and several bars closed voluntarily. To avoid encouraging large crowds, local governments in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties have ordered beaches closed through the July Fourth weekend. And on Thursday night, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Giménez announced a countywide daily curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. until further notice. He also rolled back the opening of entertainment facilities such as movie theaters, arcades, casinos, adult entertainment, concert houses and bowling alleys, effective Friday.  ""This curfew is meant to stop people from venturing out and hanging out with friends in groups, which has shown to be spreading the virus rapidly,"" he said.    Coronavirus Live Updates Florida Officials Spar Over Rising COVID-19 CasesDeSantis said he believes these measures are reminding residents they need to be careful. ""Now, people understand, this thing doesn't just go away,"" he said. ""You can do a lot of things if you take some small precautions.""  The rising numbers of coronavirus cases have raised questions about DeSantis' leadership and his close ties to Trump, whom he consulted before allowing businesses to begin reopening.   Democratic U.S. Rep. Donna Shalala, who represents parts of Miami, said, ""In their rush to reopen, they've put politics ahead of public health."" Shalala said DeSantis made a mistake by not acting sooner to shut the state down. ""We needed at the beginning to hit this virus with a hammer, to starve it all the way down,"" she said. ""We didn't do the right thing in the beginning, and now we're trying to play catch-up."""

Jae C. Hong/AP                    The United States has reached a daily global record for the coronavirus pandemic — reporting more than 55,000 new COVID-19 cases. The daily U.S. tally stood at 55,274 late Thursday, which exceeds the previous single-day record of 54,771 set by Brazil on June 19. Johns Hopkins University & Medicine's Coronavirus Resource Center, which tracks the virus worldwide, says the total number of cases reported in the U.S. stands at 2,739,879, an increase of 53,399 over Wednesday's figure. Brazil has the next highest number of cases with 1,496,858. Russia rounds out the top three with 660,231 cases. U.S. deaths attributed to the coronavirus stands at 128,740. Brazil ranks second with 61,884 deaths and the United Kingdom third with 44,080 deaths. As infections spike in the U.S., a number of states are taking action to try to slow the spread of cases. Florida's surge of COVID-19 cases shows no signs of slowing down. The state Department of Heath reported Florida set another daily record Thursday, with 10,109 cases, surpassing Saturday's record of 9,585 cases. The milestone continues a marked upturn in cases that began last month, weeks after Florida started allowing businesses to reopen.  In Texas, another coronavirus hot spot, wearing face masks is now required in most of the state. Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order on Thursday requiring Texans to wear face coverings in public in counties with 20 or more COVID-19 cases. The announcement comes as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to surge, with the state reporting 7,915 new cases on Thursday. Kansas is also now requiring face coverings after a 46% spike in infections there last week. Gov. Laura Kelly's order, with some exceptions, requires people to wear masks indoors or outdoors where 6 feet of social distancing cannot be maintained. Arizona is contending with one of the worst outbreaks of any state as coronavirus cases surge. Hospitals are bracing for a wave of seriously ill patients, and health officials are pleading with the public to wear masks and heed guidance about social distancing — even in the absence of a second stay-at-home order. Arizona was quick to relax restrictions on businesses and reopen its economy, beginning in early May. Most new cases have come in just the past month. California, another coronavirus epicenter, saw positive tests climb 37% with hospitalizations up 56% over the past two weeks. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department West Hollywood Station stepped up enforcement of an order from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, saying in a Facebook post that it would issue citations that come with a $250 fine and $50 in fees. As the country celebrates the July Fourth holiday weekend, health officials will be on alert. Following May's Memorial Day holiday, coronavirus hospitalizations rose sharply in several states."

""The money is definitely more than it normally is."" He says he's not too worried about potential exposure to the virus because he doesn't touch or talk to people when running orders, and he carries his own hand wipes around to disinfect any surfaces he comes in contact with. Uber Eats recently announced it would be providing drivers with sanitization products.  Other drivers coming in and out of restaurants wear gloves and wipe down door handles before touching them. Some people decline to be interviewed for this piece for sanitary reasons.  And some drivers worry that continuing to deliver food will ultimately put their health at risk. Online, campaigns like #PayUp —  a movement on behalf of gig economy workers — are demanding that companies such as Instacart, DoorDash and Grubhub take more precautions to protect their drivers, many of whom can't afford to stop working because of the coronavirus.   The Coronavirus Crisis Empty Grocery Shelves Are Alarming, But They're Not PermanentSo far, there's been some response.  Uber recently updated its sick policy to say it'll provide up to two weeks' financial assistance to drivers who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed in quarantine by public health authorities. Postmates says it's also offering to help with medical expenses for drivers who meet certain requirements.  And across apps, there seems to be a push for customers to choose the ""contactless delivery"" option that asks drivers to leave food outside doors and on front porches. ""I'm not that close to [people] when I hand off the food and go,"" says Stephanie Session as she heads inside Patria Cocina to pick up an order.  She started delivering for Uber Eats last year, but she says that since social distancing became encouraged, the volume of weekday orders is matching that of a busy weekend. And to her, more orders and better tips makes the work worth it.  It's unclear when restaurants will fully reopen. But workers like Session plan to keep delivering as long as orders keep coming in — and there may be more drivers soon.  DoorDash is rolling out a new ""priority access"" program for in-house restaurant employees who would like to start delivering during their unexpected time off.  Back at Krog Street Market, as he carefully loads food into his car, Willis summarizes the situation: ""People still gotta eat."" "

Lynne Sladky/AP                    With its ride-hailing business devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, Uber is in talks to acquire online food delivery company Grubhub. If the two sides can reach a deal, the combined company would emerge as the dominant food-delivery app with 55% of the U.S. market, according to analyst Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities. ""Clearly this would be an aggressive move by Uber to take out a major competitor on the Uber Eats front and further consolidate its market share position, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to shift more of a focus to deliveries versus ride-sharing in the near term,"" Ives wrote in a note to investors. With so many people unwilling or unable to go out to restaurants because of the coronavirus pandemic, demand for food delivery has surged. Competition among the various apps, including DoorDash and Postmates, has intensified.  The Coronavirus Crisis As Restaurants Across The Country Close Their Doors, Deliveries Pick UpDespite a spike in orders, none of the top food-delivery apps are turning a profit. That has caused discussion about mergers to swirl for some time. The pandemic has sped up those deliberations, says analyst Tom White with D.A. Davidson. ""We've long believed that consolidation in online food delivery is inevitable,"" he wrote in an email to NPR. White predicts food-delivery apps will remain popular even after the economy gets moving again. In March — the most recent month for which data is available — DoorDash was the most popular meal-delivery service, with some 42% of all U.S. sales in the category, according to analytics firm Second Measure. It was trailed by Grubhub with 28% and Uber Eats with 20%.  Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told investors during an earnings call last week that as its ride-hailing business has nose-dived, enlisting drivers to deliver food to doorsteps may become a larger part of the company's future.  Business Delivery Only: The Rise Of Restaurants With No Diners As Apps Take Orders""The big opportunity we thought Eats was just got bigger,"" Khosrowshahi said. He argued that a merged food-delivery company could be a boon for both restaurants and diners. ""There is a bunch of consolidation happening on a global basis where bigger players can not only provide better service for restaurants and consumers, but can provide a better service kind of on an economic basis that is sustainable,"" Khosrowshahi said. But the merger chatter comes as cities across the country are cracking down on food-delivery apps by capping the fees they can charge per order. Some restaurant owners say the fees, which can range from 10% to 40% of the total bill, hurt their bottom lines at a time when the industry is struggling to survive. Companies like Grubhub counter that they are widening restaurants' customer bases and that the higher-end fees reflect the additional marketing services that they provide to restaurant owners who choose it. Food delivery apps also contend it would be more costly for restaurants to develop their own technology and pay for their own drivers to deliver meals.  Coronavirus Live Updates Uber Cuts Thousands of Jobs, Citing Coronavirus PandemicA deal between Uber and Grubhub may run into problems with federal regulators. Analyst White said antitrust regulators may inspect the potential merger closely given the impact it could have on the restaurant sector at a time of deep peril for the industry. U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who chairs the House's antitrust subcommittee, has come out in opposition of a deal. In a statement, he characterized the potential merger in starkly critical terms. ""Uber is a notoriously predatory company that has long denied its drivers a living wage,"" Cicilline said. ""Its attempt to acquire Grubhub — which has a history of exploiting local restaurants through deceptive tactics and extortionate fees — marks a new low in pandemic profiteering."""

Mark Lennihan/AP                    For an idea of why independent restaurants have long complained about food delivery apps, just ask Anil Bathwal, who owns The Kati Roll Company, a group of New York City restaurants serving Indian street food.  Bathwal relied on a handful of food apps to supplement his dining-in purchases, despite hefty commissions the apps tack on to every sale; he used Grubhub-owned Seamless, Uber Eats, Postmates and other food-ferrying services.  If someone ordered two kati rolls for about $12, the apps took a hefty chunk of that sale: roughly a 17% commission on top of a fee for delivering the food to someone's door. In the end, Bathwal said, that kati roll purchased on the delivery app would net his restaurant about $7. App commissions were more manageable when it represented a smaller segment of overall revenue. But the pandemic changed that.  ""That's the only game right now. There's no other way for people to get business because of the lockdown,"" Bathwal says. ""If it starts becoming 30%, 40%, 50% of your business, it is not incremental business — it is your business.""  With already thin profit margins further diluted by the app fees, Bathwal could not justify keeping his six locations open. He temporarily shuttered all of his restaurants with hopes of reopening, when he can, on a pared-down menu emphasizing items that are the most affordable to make.   The Coronavirus Crisis Uber Woos Grubhub, In A Move Lawmaker Calls 'Pandemic Profiteering' He expects food delivery apps to represent a sizable portion of his sales when he can restart his business, but he is not yet sure whether he will be able to make the numbers work out. In a bid to help struggling restaurants, cities from Seattle to Washington, D.C., are passing caps restricting how much food apps can charge to deliver meals. The food delivery apps have different ways of devising fees, but they tend to be in the range of 20% to 40% of how much a restaurant makes in app-generated revenue.  On Wednesday, New York became the latest city to pass commission limits: third-party delivery services will not be able to charge more than 15% per order, and the tech companies cannot add more than 5% for other fees, like credit card processing and for better placement on the apps.  Councilman Mark Gjonaj, who sponsored the bill, said the food delivery apps have placed some restaurants on life support, but it is not sustainable.  ""Without them, it's an instant death. With them, it's a slow death,"" Gjonaj said in an interview.  Grubhub, which controls two-thirds of New York City's food delivery market, claims the commission ceiling could have an unintended consequence for restaurants.  The Salt Uber's Online-Only Restaurants: The Future, Or The End Of Dining Out?New York's fee cap was passed as an emergency measure and applies for as long as restaurants remain closed and for 90 days after eateries are able to reopen.  ""Any arbitrary cap — regardless of the duration — will lower order volume to locally-owned restaurants, increase costs for small business owners, and raise costs on customers,"" Grubhub spokesman John Collins said in a statement. ""Delivery workers would have fewer work opportunities and lower earnings. We also believe that any cap on fees represents an overstep by local officials and will not withstand a legal challenge."" A spokesperson for Postmates said in a statement that limiting commissions makes it harder to operate and ""kills the whole industry's ability to provide the services restaurants need to stay open during this national emergency."" Lawyer Gregory Frank is skeptical about this reasoning. Frank filed a federal lawsuit in Manhattan last month seeking class-action status accusing Grubhub, Doordash, Postmates and Uber Eats of ripping off both customers and restaurants.  Frank points to a clause in the contracts restaurants and the food delivery apps agree to that prohibits owners from charging delivery customers more than people who dine in, even though delivery costs more.  The Coronavirus Crisis As Restaurants Across The Country Close Their Doors, Deliveries Pick Up""By not forcing those purchasing on apps to bear the whole amount of the fees, instead forcing all menu prices to rise together, in-restaurant diners are effectively subsidizing Grubhub's high rates,"" said Frank, who argues such an arrangement is anti-competitive and illegal. Grubhub and the other food delivery apps have not yet filed legal responses to the complaint. Despite the commissions, PitchBook analyst Asad Hussain notes that none of the major food delivery apps are turning a profit.  ""Capping these fees will present a headwind for these companies. It's going to have an impact on growth, and ultimately some of these costs are going to be passed on to consumers, and that's going to reduce demand for these services,"" said Hussain, who expects the coronavirus to hasten consolidation among the delivery apps.   Business Delivery Only: The Rise Of Restaurants With No Diners As Apps Take OrdersWith or without the food delivery apps, some restaurants that have had revenue wiped out will never come back after the pandemic.  A survey from the National Restaurant Association found that the pandemic has caused 4 in 10 eateries to close, and some will never be able to open again. Bathwal with The Kati Roll Company said one of his top tasks ahead of any reopening is trying to negotiate with his landlords.  ""Landlords have been understanding. Some of them are deferring. Some are giving us a little bit of a rent abatement,"" he says. ""So we're hopeful, but we really don't know what's going to happen."""

Claire Harbage/NPR                    Updated June 24 at 10:17 p.m. ET The Trump administration is adding two new political appointees to the U.S. Census Bureau, raising concerns among some Democrats and the country's largest professional association of statisticians about partisan interference with the ongoing national head count. Nathaniel Cogley, a political science professor at Tarleton State University based near Fort Worth, Texas, is joining the federal government's largest statistical agency in a newly created position of deputy director for policy, while Adam Korzeniewski — a former political consultant to a YouTube personality known for racist pranks — is serving as a senior advisor to Cogley, according to a statement by Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham in a press release issued Tuesday. In a separate statement to NPR, the bureau says that both of the new appointees have been working on census-related issues since April as advisors to the deputy secretary at the Commerce Department, which oversees the bureau. While the bureau says Cogley and Korzeniewski will ""support the director from a policy standpoint, especially in relation to present demands and future innovations,"" it is unclear what kind of authority either will have over the count of every person living in the U.S. that the Constitution requires every 10 years. The results are used to determine each state's share of congressional seats, Electoral College votes and an estimated $1.5 trillion a year in federal tax dollars for health care, education and other public services.  It is also not clear what qualifies Cogley to help run the Census Bureau, where day-to-day operations have been overseen by Deputy Director Ron Jarmin, an economist and career civil servant who has spent more than a quarter of century at the bureau. The bureau tells NPR that Cogley's new role ""does not affect the portfolio"" of Jarmin, who also serves as the agency's chief operating officer. Dillingham's statement made no mention of either appointee's experience in the bureau's bread-and-butter work, including statistics, demography and survey methodology. Instead, the press release highlighted the ""distinguished academic background"" of Cogley — who, according to a resume on his personal website, focused on African politics and international relations while studying for a Ph.D at Yale University — as well as Korzeniewski's ""exemplary military and public service experience, including prior Census Bureau fieldwork."" Korzeniewski has worked as a lead field manager for the 2020 census in the Queens borough of New York, according to the bureau's statement to NPR. The bureau has also confirmed to NPR that the U.S. Marine Corps veteran served as a consultant to the political campaign of Joseph Saladino, a social media personality known as ""Joey Salads"" who gained notoriety for staging prank videos, including racist depictions of Black people, and ended a run for Congress as a Republican last year. Saladino's campaign paid Korzeniewski $30,000 for ""general campaign consulting,"" according to Federal Election Commission filings. Cogley has not responded to NPR's requests for comment, and a person who answered a phone number publicly listed under Korzeniewski's name redirected NPR's request to the Census Bureau's public information office. The bureau declined to comment on who decided to create their new positions and the categories of their political appointments.  Coronavirus Live Updates Skipped The Census? A Knock On Your Door May Be Coming As Early As JulyTuesday's announcement sparked criticism from Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee that oversees the bureau. ""The decision to create two new senior positions at the Census Bureau and fill them with political operatives is yet another unprecedented attempt by the Trump Administration to politicize the 2020 Census,"" Maloney said in a written statement. In a statement released Wednesday, the American Statistical Association's board of directors calls for Dillingham to provide an explanation to U.S. taxpayers that justifies the need for these new political appointments, which the board said are ""in direct conflict with the bureau's mission to ensure proper, accurate, and timely delivery of statistical information to the public."" Terri Ann Lowenthal, a census consultant who once served as the staff director of the former House oversight subcommittee for the census and advised President Barack Obama's transition team, notes that it is unusual to have a second deputy director at the bureau.  National Do Trump Officials Plan To Break Centuries Of Precedent In Divvying Up Congress?""It's hard to draw any other conclusion other than the White House is trying to keep a close eye on the final implementation of the census with the possibility that they could interfere in the Census Bureau's efforts to take the best census possible,"" Lowenthal says. The appointments come at a critical moment for the beleaguered 2020 census, which has been upended by the coronavirus pandemic. The bureau says the outbreak has so delayed its plans that it needs Congress to change legal deadlines for reporting census results so that the bureau has more time to finish counting the country's residents by the end of October. After announcing a shutdown of fieldwork in late March because of stay-at-home orders, the bureau is now preparing to send door knockers to neighborhoods around the U.S. starting next month to try to conduct in-person interviews with households that have not yet filled out forms for the count. Meanwhile, the bureau is under pressure from an executive order by President Trump to use government records to produce census block-level citizenship data — an alternative to the administration's failed attempt to add the now-blocked citizenship question to the 2020 census. That data, a GOP strategist concluded, would be ""advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites"" when voting districts are redrawn after detailed demographic data from the 2020 census are released. With the national self-response rate for the census at close to 62% as of Monday — leaving roughly four in 10 homes nationwide yet to be counted — one of the major challenges facing the bureau in these final months of counting is declining public trust in the government, especially among historically undercounted groups, including communities of color, who are less likely to participate in the count on their own.  National To Figure Out Who's A Citizen, Trump Administration Is Using These RecordsThese new appointments could undermine efforts by the bureau and community groups around the country to boost census participation, warns Vanita Gupta, who heads The Leadership Conference Education Fund, a census advocacy group, and previously served at the Justice Department during the Obama administration. ""It is concerning that the White House is apparently playing partisan political games again with the 2020 Census,"" Gupta said in a written statement. John Thompson, a former Census Bureau director who was appointed by Obama after working 27 years at the agency and left that top post during the Trump administration's first year, is concerned about how elevating a political appointee focused on policy to the agency's highest ranks could harm the bureau's reputation. ""It raises the specter that the administration will attempt to influence the objective data that the Census Bureau puts out,"" Thompson says, putting extra emphasis on ""attempt"" because he says he has the ""greatest confidence"" that career staffers will not produce biased statistics or make political decisions. ""If they were pressured, they would resist to the point of resigning,"" Thompson adds. NPR researcher Will Chase contributed to this report."

Matt Rourke/AP                    The Census Bureau says it is continuing the gradual relaunch of limited field operations for the 2020 census next week in nine states where the coronavirus pandemic forced the hand-delivery of paper forms in rural areas to be suspended in mid-March. On May 13, some local census offices in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington are scheduled to restart that fieldwork, according to an updated schedule the bureau published on its website Friday.  All workers are expected to be trained in CDC guidance in preventing the spread of COVID-19, and besides a new reusable face mask for every 10 days worked and a pair of gloves for each work day, the bureau has ordered 2 ounces of hand sanitizer for each census worker conducting field operations, the bureau tells NPR in an email. The announcement means more households that receive their mail at post office boxes or drop points are expected to find paper questionnaires left outside their front doors soon. In areas where access to the online census form at my2020census.gov can be spotty, paper forms help ensure that all homes can participate in the once-a-decade head count of every U.S. resident.  The results are used to determine how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets through 2030. They also guide the redrawing of voting districts and the distribution of an estimated $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding for schools, roads and other public services in local communities. The Census Bureau also announced on Friday that fingerprinting for newly hired census workers will pick up again next week in and around Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Pittsburgh. With responses from close to 86 million households bringing the national self-response rate to just over 58% as of Thursday, the federal government is relying on staffing up with enough door knockers to complete the count. They're currently scheduled to make in-person visits to unresponsive homes starting in August. Last month, Census Bureau officials asked Congress to consider pushing back the legal deadlines for delivering census data used to reapportion House seats and reshape voting maps by four months because of the delays brought on by the coronavirus. In a letter to U.S. Senate leaders released on Friday, more than a dozen Democratic senators led by Brian Schatz of Hawaii are calling for the next COVID-19 relief package to include more funding and requirements for the Census Bureau ""to keep both field workers and the public safe while conducting this constitutionally required enumeration.""

""We have passed the point where we could even meet the current legislative requirement of Dec. 31. We can't do that anymore,"" Tim Olson, the head of field operations for this year's national head count, said Tuesday during a webinar organized by the National Congress of American Indians. ""We're hopeful Congress will take action."" Last month, bureau officials told members of the U.S. Congress they also need more time to prepare the detailed census data currently due to state redistricting officials by March 31, 2021.  Four-month deadline extensions were included in the latest coronavirus relief package the House passed earlier this month.  But with bipartisan talks with the Republican-led Senate and the Trump administration stalled, Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., says he helped introduce the new House bill Wednesday to try to get clarity about the census timeline sooner. Gomez tells NPR he's worried that negotiations over the next relief package could spill into late June or early July, and he has been ""in conversations"" with counterparts in the Senate to encourage the other side of Capitol Hill to introduce a similar bill. ""We're running out of time,"" Gomez says. ""If we don't get our act together, the states are going to have some serious problems moving forward."" The National Conference of State Legislatures' executive director, Tim Storey, flagged the ""conundrum"" facing many states in a letter this week to Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham. ""Census delays present serious hurdles for states constrained by state constitutional and statutory requirements for districting and elections,"" Storey wrote.  For now, the Census Bureau says it's planning to keep counting for the 2020 census through Oct. 31, although it has yet to announce any new plans for going door to door to complete the count in some American Indian tribal territories that remain on lockdown, or for counting people experiencing homelessness. This week, a group of Senate Democrats led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California asked Dillingham to provide by June 2 a detailed explanation of the bureau's next steps for counting the homeless population. As of Tuesday, the national self-response rate was a sliver of a percentage point away from the bureau's pre-pandemic benchmark of 60.5%. Bureau officials were hoping to reach that rate by the end of April before sending door knockers out to visit unresponsive homes that had been asked to fill out forms themselves but hadn't done so yet. The coronavirus has forced the bureau to delay the start of that door knocking until Aug. 11. This month, the bureau started sending out census workers again to some rural areas, as well as communities in Puerto Rico, that have been waiting for months to have paper forms left outside of their front doors."

Four-month deadline extensions were included in the latest coronavirus relief package the House passed earlier this month.  But with bipartisan talks with the Republican-led Senate and the Trump administration stalled, Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., says he helped introduce the new House bill Wednesday to try to get clarity about the census timeline sooner. Gomez tells NPR he's worried that negotiations over the next relief package could spill into late June or early July, and he has been ""in conversations"" with counterparts in the Senate to encourage the other side of Capitol Hill to introduce a similar bill. ""We're running out of time,"" Gomez says. ""If we don't get our act together, the states are going to have some serious problems moving forward."" The National Conference of State Legislatures' executive director, Tim Storey, flagged the ""conundrum"" facing many states in a letter this week to Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham. ""Census delays present serious hurdles for states constrained by state constitutional and statutory requirements for districting and elections,"" Storey wrote.  For now, the Census Bureau says it's planning to keep counting for the 2020 census through Oct. 31, although it has yet to announce any new plans for going door to door to complete the count in some American Indian tribal territories that remain on lockdown, or for counting people experiencing homelessness. This week, a group of Senate Democrats led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California asked Dillingham to provide by June 2 a detailed explanation of the bureau's next steps for counting the homeless population. As of Tuesday, the national self-response rate was a sliver of a percentage point away from the bureau's pre-pandemic benchmark of 60.5%. Bureau officials were hoping to reach that rate by the end of April before sending door knockers out to visit unresponsive homes that had been asked to fill out forms themselves but hadn't done so yet. The coronavirus has forced the bureau to delay the start of that door knocking until Aug. 11. This month, the bureau started sending out census workers again to some rural areas, as well as communities in Puerto Rico, that have been waiting for months to have paper forms left outside of their front doors."

John Raoux/AP                    In Florida, where there's a surge of new COVID-19 cases, officials are divided over what to do about it. The state saw 2,783 new cases Tuesday. It was the third time in the past seven days that Florida set a new daily record. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Republican officials, including President Trump, say the rising number of new cases was expected and is mostly the result of increased testing. Florida is now testing more than 200,000 people a week, more than double the number tested weekly in mid-May. But local officials and public health experts are concerned about other statistics that show that the coronavirus is still spreading in Florida. The state's Department of Health reports that the number of people showing up in hospital emergency rooms with symptoms of the flu and COVID-19 is rising. Also worrisome — the percentage of people who are testing positive for the virus is going up.     Coronavirus Live Updates Florida's Rising COVID-19 Numbers: What Do They Mean?In Palm Beach County, health director Alina Alonso says the rising positivity rate is a clear sign that the new cases can't just be attributed to increased testing. Since Palm Beach County began allowing businesses to reopen, Alonso says, the percentage of people testing positive has jumped from 4.9% to 8.9%. ""The fact that these are going up means there's more community spread,"" she says. ""The virus now has food out there. It has people that are out there without masks, without maintaining distancing. So it's infecting more people."" Alonso say the number of people hospitalized for the coronavirus has also gone up in Palm Beach County. ""The numbers are very concerning to the hospitals,"" she says. So far, the number of deaths from COVID-19 has remained low. But Alonso says deaths lag behind new recorded cases by about six weeks. She thinks the number of deaths will also rise. ""We need to be cautious at this time. Wait a little bit until we see whether or not that happens,"" she says. ""If we go forward without waiting to see what is going on ... by the time we get those deaths, it will be too late.""   Palm Beach County currently isn't requiring residents to wear face coverings when in public places. County commissioners are now considering following the lead of Broward and Miami-Dade counties and making face masks mandatory.  The Coronavirus Crisis Fired Florida Data Scientist Launches A Coronavirus Dashboard Of Her OwnIn Tallahassee, DeSantis held a news conference where he responded to concerns about the rising positivity rate. Much of it, he said, is related to outbreaks among farmworkers and people in prison. Among the incidents he highlighted — a watermelon farm near Gainesville where, out of 100 workers tested, 90 were positive. DeSantis said, ""When you have 90 out of 100 test positive, what that does to positivity — that's huge numbers."" Some of the other localized outbreaks among farmworkers, he noted, were in Palm Beach County. DeSantis said there's no reason to consider rolling back the rules allowing businesses to reopen at the moment. He has encouraged the resumption of sports events and attended a NASCAR race in Homestead, Fla., on Sunday with a few hundred other spectators. And he successfully lobbied for Florida to host President Trump's acceptance speech at a Republican National Convention event in Jacksonville. That gathering is expected to draw thousands.  Democrats have become increasingly critical, saying DeSantis is ignoring important data that favor a more cautious response. Florida's top elected Democrat, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, said, ""Refusing to acknowledge the alarming patterns in cases, hospitalizations and positivity is not only arrogant but will cost lives, public health and our economy."""

Cliff Hawkins/Getty Images                    As it struggles to control a rising number of new cases of the coronavirus, Florida took a dramatic step, suspending the consumption of alcohol on the premises at bars statewide. Officials in Texas took a similar step Friday, requiring bars to close at noon and be available only for takeout and delivery. The order in Florida came as the state recorded another spike Friday. The state's Department of Health says 8,942 people tested positive for the coronavirus, the highest total yet, eclipsing the record of 5,508 cases two days ago. Florida set another record with the number of people tested — 71,433, over 13,000 more than the previous high. The percentage of people testing positive was just over 13%. It's another indication that measures to stop the spread of the virus have fallen short in Florida. After weeks of declining numbers, COVID-19 cases began steeply rising two weeks ago. Florida is one of the states that began allowing reopening early, in the beginning of May.  Coronavirus Live Updates Florida Passes 100,000 COVID-19 CasesFor days, as the number of cases rose, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis maintained it was largely because of the increase in testing. He also cited outbreaks among farmworkers and prison populations as factors behind the rising numbers. But over the past week, as the percentage of people testing positive spiked, the governor has cited community spread as a serious problem, citing behavior by people in their 20s and 30s. Over the past week, a number of bars in Florida shut down voluntarily after the coronavirus spread among staff and customers.  Enlarge this image                Florida Gov.

John Raoux/AP                    This week, DeSantis held a news conference with Florida's secretary of business and professional regulation to announce a crackdown on bars and restaurants that aren't following the guidelines. ""If you go in and it's just like mayhem, like Dance Party USA and it's packed to the rafters, DeSantis said, ""that's not just an innocent mistake."" Florida suspended the license of a bar in the Orlando area. Local officials throughout the state also say they're cracking down on businesses that don't follow guidelines requiring face coverings, social distancing and limiting occupancy. And today's step, suspending the consumption of alcohol at bars statewide, is effectively a new shutdown for the businesses that had only recently reopened. It's also an acknowledgment that some parts of Florida's reopening may have come too fast.  Coronavirus Live Updates Florida's Rising COVID-19 Numbers: What Do They Mean?Officials and doctors in Florida say despite the surge in cases, hospital capacity remains good statewide. Doctors say they're seeing younger people now with COVID-19. In some counties, the median age for those testing positive is now younger than 30. At Orlando Health, a large hospital system in central Florida, Dr. Sunil Desai says of the cases they're seeing, ""The acuity is less, a lot less folks using or requiring mechanical ventilation or the severe presentations of COVID.

Joan Mateu/AP                    U.S. travelers won't be among those allowed to visit the European Union when the bloc begins opening its external borders on July 1. EU ambassadors endorsed a list of 15 travel partners on Tuesday, including South Korea, Japan and, with a caveat, China. Those countries were hit early by the pandemic but have been able to bring the coronavirus under control. The EU list requires reciprocal easing of travel bans — and the U.S. currently bars most travelers from European countries. China's inclusion on the travel list is predicated on its removal of EU members from its own travel restrictions. The U.S. was seen as a long shot to make the travel list, which requires that only those countries with epidemiological situations — taking into account both the infection rate and current trends — that are equal to or better than the EU's can send tourists and other nonessential visitors to the open-border region. When the EU began discussing its travel list earlier this month, many U.S. states were seeing a worrying spike in cases — a trend that has only worsened.  As ambassadors at the European Council debated the final list, the U.S. shattered its record for daily new cases, reporting 39,972 new cases on June 26, compared with its previous mark of 36,291 cases, which was set on April 24. They've done it! Border battle over.Citizens from these countries can come to the EU tomorrow: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, S Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay & China when it drops restrictions on EU nationals.— Teri Schultz (@terischultz) June 30, 2020The allowed countries are:  Algeria Australia Canada Georgia Japan Montenegro Morocco New Zealand Rwanda Serbia South Korea Thailand Tunisia Uruguay China (subject to confirmation of reciprocity)  It's up to each EU member state to decide how to implement the list — but the European Council says none of them should unilaterally lift travel restrictions on a ""non-listed"" country. Now that the EU travel list has been released, the bloc plans to revise it on a regular basis, as frequently as every two weeks. For now, the U.S. is excluded along with other countries that are struggling to fight the coronavirus, such as Brazil and Russia. The EU has roughly 116 million more people than the U.S. But the bloc is currently reporting roughly 1.5 million coronavirus cases — far less than the more than 2.6 million cases reported by the U.S. And in a troubling sign of how deeply the coronavirus has taken root in the U.S., the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the official tally is vastly undercounted, with more than 20 million Americans possibly infected. ""Our best estimate right now is that for every case that was reported, there actually were 10 other infections,"" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said last week. As it issued the travel list, the EU also provided more clarity about how it analyzes other countries' coronavirus status. In addition to looking at the number of new cases over the past 14 days, for instance, the European standard calls for a country's case rate per 100,000 inhabitants to be ""close to or below the EU average."" When U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked about the possible exclusion of the U.S. last week, he said discussions are ongoing. ""I am confident that we will find a set of conditions that create sufficient health and safety protections"" and still allow travel, Pompeo said at a press briefing. If no U.S. tourists visit Europe in the coming months, it would deal another financial blow to an already ailing travel and hospitality industry. Last year, roughly 2 million or more Americans visited Europe in each month from May through September, according to the U.S. National Travel & Tourism Office. The pandemic has turned travel into a fraught topic, over fears of the possible spread of the virus. It has also caused tension between the EU and the U.S., particularly after President Trump announced a travel ban on 26 European countries (exempting the United Kingdom) in mid-March. EU officials publicly registered their disapproval, saying they had not been warned about the ban. Days later, the EU began closing its own borders.

On Monday, the state reported almost 6,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19. That's a record, as cases spike following the state's reopening of bars, restaurants and stores in early May. Because of this latest surge, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott recently reversed the reopening, closing bars and cutting restaurant capacity. Houston Methodist Hospital — the flagship hospital of the Houston Methodist system — has enough beds, says Roberta Schwartz, who holds multiple executive positions at the hospital, including chief innovation officer. But that's because she's making room at the expense of other services.  ""If you look within the hospital, what it looks and feels like here right now is that every day I am clearing out another unit and I am putting in COVID patients,"" she says. She says she has seen an uptick in cases at the hospital since just after Memorial Day. Here are excerpts of Schwartz's Morning Edition conversation. On making room for COVID-19 patients So when we were at the point where the volumes of COVID were down, we were able to open up many of our other services. And what we found when we opened up a lot of our services is that many people had waited for a very long time to seek medical care and they were very sick. And so we were able to treat many of those patients both in clinics and in the hospital. ... We kind of looked at each other and said we should never do that again. We should never close down all of our services, because it was detrimental to the health of Houston. It was dangerous for people to wait to seek needed care.   And so what's been very hard is to yesterday send out yet another series of notes closing down services further because we have no choice, because we have to transition units into COVID to take care of the population. So do we have the beds? Yes. Fortunately, at this point, we have not had to put up tents or field hospitals, but each day it's more and more.  On seeing videos and pictures from across Texas of people in bars and not social distancing On one hand, there are so many people who believe that this is not reality, that what you're hearing is made up or false, and I want to take them all and walk them through an ICU to see a husband and wife laying side by side intubated or seeing a 26-year-old with no comorbidities who is laying in a hospital bed for 14 days in an intubated state and say, ""It is very real."" There's a little bit of Russian roulette. You could be fine and have a sore throat and walk through this. Or you could end up in one of my units. And you don't know which one you will be. "

""There's no doubt that wearing masks protects you,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told members of Congress on Tuesday.  Shots - Health News Yes, Wearing Masks Helps. Here's WhyWhile mask usage has been the subject of partisan debate, leading Republicans such as Vice President Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy have been newly vocal in expressing their support for face coverings in recent days. Other officials, such as presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are advocating for a federal mask mandate.  ""When you do not wear your face covering, we end up in a situation where you see higher rates of disease spread and you end up having to close places,"" Surgeon General Jerome Adams said at a public briefing Tuesday. ""This mask, this face covering, actually is an instrument of freedom for Americans if we all use it."" According to new research by Goldman Sachs, a national mask mandate could save nearly 5% of gross domestic product in addition to cutting the daily growth rate of confirmed coronavirus cases to 0.6%.

Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images                    Updated July 3 at 11:34 a.m. ET With around four out of 10 homes in the U.S. yet to be tallied for the national head count, the Census Bureau has announced the first six places in the U.S. where unresponsive households will get in-person visits starting later this month. Beginning July 16, the bureau's door knockers are fanning out across Idaho, Maine and West Virginia, as well as parts of southeastern Louisiana, northern Missouri and northwestern Oklahoma, the bureau said Wednesday. Households that want to avoid interacting with a census worker at their front door can still fill out a form online, on paper or over the phone. The bureau says it plans to collect responses through the end of October, although attempts to conduct in-person interviews with unresponsive households are set to begin nationwide on Aug. 11. These follow-up visits make up the largest and most expensive operation of the constitutionally mandated count, which determines the distribution of political power and federal funding for the next decade.  The coronavirus pandemic and stay-at-home orders had forced the bureau to push back the start of these visits from May, and now the bureau is beginning to ramp up efforts as the number of COVID-19 cases continue to climb in many parts of the country.   The bureau says it's testing out new procedures for its workers, including social distancing, by trying to conduct interviews this week with around 80 homes in Idaho and in the area surrounding its local office in Nashville, Tenn. The bureau is also under increased scrutiny from some Democratic leaders in Congress, the American Economic Association, the Population Association of America and other census advocates over new political appointments by the Trump administration that have raised fears about an attempt to interfere with the census. In a press release, the bureau says career officials decided where to start these visits based in part on ""the ability of Census Bureau staff to safely resume operations."" In May, the bureau confirmed to NPR that its field workers should each receive 2 ounces of hand sanitizer, a new reusable face mask for every 10 days worked and a pair of gloves for each work day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wear face coverings in public to help prevent spreading the coronavirus to others. But according to the bureau's press release, census workers will wear them ""if masks are required in the area"" where they're knocking on doors. In Idaho, where the bureau says census workers made a few home visits this week and are preparing to do more starting July 16, only a handful of cities have issued requirements for face coverings. The bureau's public information office has not yet responded to NPR's question about why the federal agency is instructing workers to follow local public health guidelines about face coverings and not the CDC's recommendation. Whether the bureau can meet the Constitution's once-a-decade requirement to count every person living in the U.S. largely hinges on the bureau's ability to reach unresponsive homes in these final months for the count. The bureau's research shows that people of color, immigrants and other historically undercounted groups are less likely to participate in the census on their own because of distrust in the government and low awareness about the count's role in determining each state's share of an estimated $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding for public services, as well as congressional seats and Electoral College votes. A recent report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office warns that public health concerns about close interactions could make it more difficult for the bureau to complete door-to-door visits and, in turn, affect the quality of the information collected for the census. On top of these challenges, Tim Olson, the head of field operations for this year's national head count, said in May that the bureau had ""passed the point"" of being able to meet the current legal deadline for reporting the latest state population counts to the president by the end of December. The bureau has asked Congress to pass a new law that would extend that deadline, as well as the one for producing redistricting data to the states, by four months. So far, only Democrats in the House and Senate have introduced bills."

Joel Page/AP                    Steven Marson had more than 100 contracts for public fireworks displays, the majority of them scheduled for this weekend, before the pandemic hit Maine and prompted cancellations. Now he has eight. Marson, who runs Central Maine Pyrotechnics, says the steep decline in business has cost him about $1 million so far.  ""I could be out of business if this continues into 2021 because I don't have the means to keep going when you have not revenue coming in,"" he says.   Marson's not alone.   Pyrotechnics companies across New England are struggling to make ends meet during what is usually their peak season.  Atlas Fireworks usually handles hundreds of municipal fireworks displays throughout New England during the Fourth of July weekend. Atlas' vice president, Matt Shea, says his business is down 90% this year. He estimates a $3 million loss at this point and acknowledges others have it worse.   ""The prospect of many fireworks display companies going out of business is a very real possibility,"" Shea says.  Shea says regional pyrotechnics companies that handle large events are primarily family-run operations. They have little additional capital to rely on when times are lean.   At the moment, Shea says small sales to individuals at the company's retail stores are keeping his business afloat. That part of the businesses is up about 30% as people try to put on their own displays. Shea and Marson say the current rate of business isn't sustainable.   They say they're part of a group of fireworks companies trying to secure additional industry-specific financial relief from Congress.  Shea says companies are hoping to get through the downturn by capitalizing on displays rescheduled for this fall or during New Year's celebrations, even though the pandemic's effects will linger long afterward.   He says there's still cause for celebration. The country's long tradition of marking the Fourth of July with fireworks will continue. Marson also says he's trying to be optimistic.

As NPR reported, Florida's Department of Health said the state set a new daily record on Thursday, with 10,109 confirmed cases. Less than a week ago, the state had surpassed a record of 9,585 confirmed cases, set on Saturday.

Matt York/AP                    Arizona is contending with one of the worst outbreaks of any state as coronavirus cases surge again across the United States. Hospitals are bracing for a wave of seriously ill patients, and health officials are pleading with the public to wear masks and heed guidance about social distancing — even in the absence of a second stay-at-home order.  Arizona was quick to relax restrictions on businesses and reopen its economy, beginning in early May. Most new cases have come in just the past month. Maricopa County, with its Phoenix metro area, now ranks as one of the top five U.S. counties for total cases.  ""Our foot is still on the accelerator, conditions are deteriorating and they're going to continue to deteriorate at least for the next two to three weeks,"" said Dr. Joe Gerald, a professor of public health at the University of Arizona who runs modeling on the coronavirus outbreak.  Gerald says the state is essentially doubling the number of cases every two weeks. Over the past week, it has averaged about 3,500 new cases a day. On Wednesday, Arizona hit a new record, with more than 4,800 positive cases. More than 1,700 people have died.   ""You don't have to play that out very long to realize we're soon going to be in considerable trouble as our safety margin for excess hospital beds is fairly quickly dwindling,"" he said. Based on current trends, Gerald said, the state might run out of licensed beds toward the end of July, but that forecast doesn't take into account whether there will be enough personnel to care for patients, even before then.   Of particular concern is that new cases continue to outpace testing capacity.  In Arizona, the portion of tests coming back positive hovers around 24%, more than three times the national average. Texas and Florida, where cases are also rising rapidly, have positivity rates of 14% and 16%, respectively.  ""There's a huge reservoir of individuals who are infected and have the ability to transmit that infection,"" Gerald said.  Younger adults are driving much of Arizona's outbreak, with many cases popping up among people in their 20s and 30s, an age group that is more likely to show mild symptoms or be asymptomatic.  That makes tracking cases even more difficult, but Gerald says it may also save Arizona's hospitals from being as overwhelmed as those in a place like New York City. ""If there's any saving grace ... it's that new cases are heavily concentrated in those best able to survive the infection,"" he said.  Still, the state is far from having the virus under control. This week, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey closed down bars, gyms and theaters. State health officials also told hospitals that they could activate their crisis standards of care plan — guidelines on how to triage patients and allocate scarce resources during an emergency.  Not every hospital needs to do that yet, though. Arizona's intensive care unit beds are currently at about 90% of capacity, according to state data.  ""There is a significant concern regarding resource availability, staff availability and just everything being overrun at some point,"" said Dr. Ross Goldberg, president of the Arizona Medical Association.  The state's largest hospital system, Banner Health, is trying to free up space for COVID-19 patients by repurposing pediatric beds and doubling up rooms. It's also bringing in hundreds of out-of-state health workers.   Ann-Marie Alameddin, president and CEO of the Arizona Hospital and Healthcare Association, says the single biggest limiting factor for hospitals right now is staffing.  ""We have the space. We have the plans to surge. We have supplies. But our health care workers are strained. And we need to call in reinforcements,"" Alameddin said.  Arizona has asked the federal government for 500 front-line health care workers to support the hospital system. On Wednesday, Vice President Pence visited Arizona and said the state would get any help it needs to handle the surge of patients.  Both Pence and Ducey wore masks during the visit, something they had been reluctant to do earlier in the pandemic.  "

It troubles him to see her cooped up in the shop all day. But, he said, ""I want you to also know that you're very calming and soothing to me. Having you there in my time of stress has calmed me down, because you're built that way."" Francesca said she gets frustrated that her dad is often so preoccupied at work, and she sometimes feels lonely.  ""The hardest part for me is you're usually busy. And I feel like some days I could just sit in the back without you even noticing me,"" she told him. Paul said he understood. Being together at the pizza shop hasn't been exactly quality time for father and daughter. But the pandemic has given them no other option. ""It is what it is,"" he told her.

Paul and Francesca Montanaro                    ""I do want you to know that sometimes I feel very guilty that you're there with me so many hours, because sometimes mommy doesn't pick you up until 7 o'clock at night or 8 o'clock at night,"" he said. Even though the situation isn't ideal, Paul said, for his part, he loves seeing Francesca at the pizzeria. ""I've seen you learning the register, and you know how to handle money now,"" he said. And he recalled with pride the day Francesca made her first pizza. ""You made the perfect pie,"" he said. ""It was perfectly round. I couldn't believe the amazing crust you made. Even my pizza guy was like, 'Oh, my God, she is a natural!' "" Francesca had one final question: ""Do you think you'd want me to take over the pizza shop and run the business?"" ""I wouldn't want you to do what I do,"" Paul said. It's not an easy business, he said. He encouraged Francesca to model herself after her mother's path into nursing. ""Whereas I can feed people, mommy can save lives,"" he said. ""And not to say that I'm not intelligent, but I see how you are and I see what you can be, and I know that that would be a lot more than what I've been in my life and am. And I think you're going to use that brain and do much better things than what I do."" Francesca is hoping to become a nurse or a psychologist. In the meantime, she's spending her summer scooping Italian ice at the pizzeria. This story was produced by Sarah Kate Kramer of Radio Diaries, with help from Joe Richman and Nellie Gilles.

Jae C. Hong/AP                    The United States has reached a daily global record for the coronavirus pandemic — reporting more than 55,000 new COVID-19 cases. The daily U.S. tally stood at 55,274 late Thursday, which exceeds the previous single-day record of 54,771 set by Brazil on June 19. Johns Hopkins University & Medicine's Coronavirus Resource Center, which tracks the virus worldwide, says the total number of cases reported in the U.S. stands at 2,739,879, an increase of 53,399 over Wednesday's figure. Brazil has the next highest number of cases with 1,496,858. Russia rounds out the top three with 660,231 cases. U.S. deaths attributed to the coronavirus stands at 128,740. Brazil ranks second with 61,884 deaths and the United Kingdom third with 44,080 deaths. As infections spike in the U.S., a number of states are taking action to try to slow the spread of cases. Florida's surge of COVID-19 cases shows no signs of slowing down. The state Department of Heath reported Florida set another daily record Thursday, with 10,109 cases, surpassing Saturday's record of 9,585 cases. The milestone continues a marked upturn in cases that began last month, weeks after Florida started allowing businesses to reopen.  In Texas, another coronavirus hot spot, wearing face masks is now required in most of the state. Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order on Thursday requiring Texans to wear face coverings in public in counties with 20 or more COVID-19 cases. The announcement comes as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to surge, with the state reporting 7,915 new cases on Thursday. Kansas is also now requiring face coverings after a 46% spike in infections there last week. Gov. Laura Kelly's order, with some exceptions, requires people to wear masks indoors or outdoors where 6 feet of social distancing cannot be maintained. Arizona is contending with one of the worst outbreaks of any state as coronavirus cases surge. Hospitals are bracing for a wave of seriously ill patients, and health officials are pleading with the public to wear masks and heed guidance about social distancing — even in the absence of a second stay-at-home order. Arizona was quick to relax restrictions on businesses and reopen its economy, beginning in early May. Most new cases have come in just the past month. California, another coronavirus epicenter, saw positive tests climb 37% with hospitalizations up 56% over the past two weeks. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department West Hollywood Station stepped up enforcement of an order from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, saying in a Facebook post that it would issue citations that come with a $250 fine and $50 in fees. As the country celebrates the July Fourth holiday weekend, health officials will be on alert. Following May's Memorial Day holiday, coronavirus hospitalizations rose sharply in several states."

Matt Dunham/AP                    England will lift a 14-day quarantine requirement on travelers from more than 50 countries and territories that have been a deemed a ""reduced risk"" for spreading the coronavirus, the U.K. government has announced. The rule change will go into effect on July 10 and will apply to places such as Italy, Spain, Germany and France, according to the government. The U.S., however, is not listed among the countries exempt from the self-isolation rule.  All international forms of travel to England will be included, and travelers from a smaller list of countries will also be exempt from contact tracing requirements.  Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own public health policies and have not announced changes to the restrictions. Currently, with more than 285,000 cases, the United Kingdom leads Western Europe in the number of reported coronavirus infections. The Department for Transport said officials will continue to review the list of exempt countries and reinstate the quarantine rule if the risk of coronavirus spread increases. ""The entire nation has worked tirelessly to get to this stage, therefore safety must remain our watch word and we will not hesitate to move quickly to protect ourselves if infection rates rise in countries we are reconnecting with,"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in the announcement.  The requirement for foreign travelers to self-isolate has been in place for a month, NPR's Frank Langfitt reports, noting the rule has been blamed for devastating the British travel industry.  Officials also hope that exempt countries would, in turn, reduce restrictions on travelers from the U.K., particularly as the summer holiday gets well underway.  ""This will mean that holidaymakers travelling to and from certain destinations will not need to self-isolate on either leg of their journey,"" the announcement stated.  Earlier this week, the European Union also left the U.S. off its list of more than a dozen countries deemed approved travel partners because they have been able to bring the coronavirus under control.  The United States has more than 2.7 million confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University's coronavirus tracker, though health experts believe the actual number may be far higher."

Mario Tama/Getty Images                    Major League Baseball is cancelling the 2020 All-Star game over concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic and restricting on mass gatherings, the league says. This year's Mid Summer Classic, planned for July 14, is the first All-Star Game cancelled since World War II. A week of fan activities around the the American and National League exhibition match-up — including the Home Run Derby — will also be put on hold this year. The Los Angeles Dodgers were set to host for the first time since 1980. ""Once it became clear we were unable to hold this year's All-Star festivities, we wanted to award the Dodgers with the next available All-Star Game, which is 2022,"" said baseball Commissioner Robert D. Manfred Jr said in a statement. Cancelling the All-Star game is the latest hit the league has taken since the pandemic began. In March, the league put a stop to spring training, just two weeks shy of what would have been opening day. Disagreements between the player's union and MLB over money and safety concerns further delayed the league's shortened 60-game season.  Late last month, both sides agreed to have opening day on July 23 or 24, with players resuming training at the beginning of the month. MLB recently introduced new rules to stem the spread of the virus among players, including a ban on spitting by players during the game.  First played in 1933, the All-Star Game has a been an annual event, save for 1945 when wartime travel restrictions interfered. The 2021 edition is set to be played in Atlanta at the Braves' Truist Park."

Camille Petersen/Camille Petersen                    Usually, bartenders at 67 Orange Street in Harlem perform in front of an audience, as they shake, pour, and light drinks on fire. People watch from stools around the bar and tightly packed tables.  Karl Franz Williams started this cocktail bar almost twelve years ago. He's watched people fall in love here and even witnessed a wedding. Williams actually named the bar in honor of a Black-owned, nineteenth century dance hall in Lower Manhattan, Almack's. That dance hall's last known address was 67 Orange Street. Williams says bars like his are theater. ""Part of it is the mystery, the throwback to history and old times, and then part of it is the actual actions of the bartenders."" Even though the usual theater is gone right now because of the pandemic, 67 Orange Street has stayed open through takeout cocktails, delivery, and outdoor dining. But Williams — and restaurant owners and operators across New York City — have been navigating a constantly shifting landscape of rules and policies as they reopen. That takes time and money, during a period when revenues have plunged and profits are stretched even thinner than usual.  Williams has been able to get his profits up to around 65 or 70 percent of his pre-shutdown normal, but he's always on edge about some of the things keeping 67 Orange Street afloat — like takeout cocktails and outdoor dining — being stripped away or changed as reopening continues. For instance, at first, Williams says takeout cocktails could be offered along with snacks. Within a week, that rule changed, and the food had to be more substantial, which meant opening 67 Orange Street's kitchen. ""As soon as the law changed, we had to shift quickly and figure out what could we put in each of these takeout orders that would meet the qualification for food but that would also keep our pricing reasonable,"" said Williams. Other rule changes, like regulations about outdoor dining and an executive order about making restaurants responsible for monitoring social distancing around their establishments, have also required restaurants to keep pivoting.  There's no word on way indoor dining will be allowed, and Williams worries rules about limited seating will make it hard to do it profitably. Alex Susskind teaches food and beverage management at Cornell University and says on top of navigating all that, restaurant owners also have a whole new job now. ""They have to make sure that their guests feel comfortable coming into their business. They're going to want to see that things are being cleaned regularly, right in front of them, where in the past restaurant operators wanted that to be invisible,"" says Susskind. That also includes keeping employees safe, with workplace safety protections and measures like temperature checks and testing. In some ways, it's a new kind of theater — keeping customers and employees safe, making sure they feel safe, and still trying to maintain some of the old magic of a restaurant. ."

At least two counties in South Texas say they have hospitals already at full capacity. This news comes after officials in Texas, California and Arizona rolled back their reopening plans. In Florida, however, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said last week that the state was ""not going back"" on reopening, saying younger people were driving the spike but that they were at less risk than older people.  Republican Miami Mayor Francis X. Suarez called the growth ""extremely worrisome"" and said the growth was partially due to the early reopening of the state. ""There's no doubt that the fact that when we reopened, people started socializing as if the virus didn't exist,"" he told ABC News. Democratic Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego told ABC News that the state may have opened up too quickly and criticized the federal government's response to the virus and the lack of testing across the state. The Arizona Republic reported that in some cases, people have had to wait in line for 13 hours to be tested. ""We opened way too early in Arizona,"" Gallego said. ""We were one of the last states to go to stay-at-home and one of the first to reemerge. And we reemerged at zero to 60."" In response to the surging cases in Arizona, authorities in Mexico tightened restrictions on some border crossings over the weekend and closed popular beaches to limit nonessential holiday travel. At the same time, President Trump said Saturday that, while cases are increasing, his administration has made ""a lot of progress"" slowing the spread of the virus. He blamed the increase in cases on the increase of testing, which experts argue is an incorrect evaluation of the spread of the disease."

The nine additional students who tested positive were close contacts of the residents, but do not live in the fraternity houses, according to a statement  from The University of Washington. The number of confirmed cases has risen steadily since the outbreak was first announced on June 30. At that point, 38 students living in 10 fraternity houses had tested positive. By July 3, at least 117 residents of 15 fraternity houses had self-reported positive test results.  ""While we were pleased to see most of the houses had previously taken measures to reduce resident capacity by up to 50% this summer in response to COVID-19, those measures are not sufficient without vigilant, daily preventive measures, such as wearing face coverings, physical distancing and hand hygiene,"" Dr. Geoffrey Gottlieb, chair of the UW Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases, said in a university statement.  The university said there are about 1,000 students living in 25 fraternity houses, with residents asked to quarantine or self-isolate in their houses if they test positive, show symptoms or may have been exposed.

States in the West and South have seen surges in cases and hospitalizations in recent weeks. On July 2, Washington reported 716 new confirmed cases — its highest daily total since the start of the pandemic — and Gov. Jay Inslee announced a temporary pause on the state's regional reopening process.   The University of Washington plans to reopen at the end of September with a hybrid model of in-person and remote instruction, as well as increased health and safety protocols. Gottlieb stressed the importance of these precautions in preventing future outbreaks.  ""What is occurring north of campus provides lessons for students as they consider their return to campus this fall,"" he said. ""If everyone does their part to keep each other safe, we can continue to engage with one another and with our studies in the University environment by wearing face coverings and remaining physically distant. If we don't, measures such as what are now required on Greek Row will be inevitable. My sense is all students want to return to some sense of normalcy, so I urge all of us to follow public health guidelines so we can do just that."" Greek life has also been tied to an outbreak in the South, where state officials linked a cluster of cases to fraternity parties at the University of Mississippi in June. "

Chesnot/Getty Images                    France's Louvre Museum reopened on Monday after closing in March due to the coronavirus. But things are far from business as usual. The world's most visited museum has implemented new measures, including a mask requirement and an online-only reservation system to protect art lovers from the virus.  One unintended consequence of these restrictions has been an experience devoid of the usual crowds of tourists, which normally reach up to 50,000 people a day.  Freddie Keen, visiting from London with some friends, told NPR it was easy to take his time seeing some of the Louvre's top attractions.  ""It was definitely a much more comfortable experience seeing the Mona Lisa without having any peer pressure from hundreds of people staring at you and waiting for you to move on,"" Keen said. Floor markers in the Salle des Etats, where the Mona Lisa is held, have been put in place to ensure guests adhere to a physical distance of at least 3 feet. Visitors must also follow a one-way path through the building. A third of the museum is still closed to the public.  The Louvre said it expected 7,000 people on the first day of reopening. International tourists made up around 70% of the 9.6 million visitors in 2019.  Museum Director Jean-Luc Martinez said he was hoping to attract more French tourists this summer because of the current travel restrictions. ""We are going to be at best 20 to 30% down on last summer,"" Martinez told Agence France-Presse, adding that the museum expects between 4,000 and 10,000 visitors a day. During the four-month shutdown, the iconic art destination lost an equivalent of $45 million in ticket sales this year, the museum director was quoted as saying.

Keith Mayhew/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images                    The British government will spend nearly $2 billion to help rescue the nation's theater, museum and arts sectors. Sunday's announcement came as more than 1,000 theaters remain shuttered across the country because of the coronavirus pandemic. The rescue package will include grants and loans that theaters, museums, live music organizations and others can use to pay salaries and maintenance costs as they try to survive the COVID-19 recession. ""We were just extremely thankful,"" said Kate Varah, executive director of the Old Vic, the famed London theater. ""The government is rightly recognizing that investment in thriving sectors at a point of crisis is a good investment, and what we don't want to do is come out of lockdown to have theaters boarded up, restaurants boarded up [and] shops unvisited wastelands."" Oliver Dowden, Britain's culture secretary, said the government would focus money on ""crown jewels"" such as the Royal Albert Hall, and emphasized that the rescue package was not a panacea for the entire culture and arts sector. ""Sadly, not everyone is going to be able to survive and not every job is going to be protected,"" Dowden told the BBC.  The announcement came a day after England permitted pubs, restaurants, museums and movie theaters to reopen. Indoor live theater is not resuming for both social distancing and financial reasons. Many Victorian-era theaters in London's West End have small seats crammed next to each other. Theaters such as the Old Vic are public charities that in the past have not relied on government subsidies but on ticket sales and public support. Varah said if the Old Vic were to hold socially distanced performances, it could only operate at 30% capacity, while it needs to sell 70% of its seats to break even. Netflix, meanwhile, is donating $625,000 to a fund set up by film and theater director Sam Mendes to provide relief to freelance theater workers who haven't been able to tap government support. Mendes has argued that companies such as Netflix, which have thrived in the lockdown entertainment economy, should help support the British theater ecosystem that has nurtured talent benefiting the American entertainment industry. For instance, Fleabag, Phoebe Waller-Bridges' Emmy-winning series and an Amazon hit, began as a one-woman show at London's Soho Theatre. The $2 billion rescue package adds to the government's enormous spending during the recession, which includes $17 billion a month to support workers' salaries. Many expect the bill for all this will ultimately fall to British taxpayers."

He died on Sunday at the age of 41, his wife, Amanda Kloots, announced on Instagram.  Kloots, a dancer and fitness instructor, detailed the ups and downs of her husband's medical condition on her Instagram page where more than 450,000 followers helped to promote a GoFundMe to help pay for his hospital bills. It raised almost $800,000. The page became a place of hope for Cordero's many fans, who Kloots encouraged to sing a song he'd written, ""Live Your Life."" Cordero had been in Los Angeles in March, working on an immersive production of Rock of Ages, when he developed symptoms of pneumonia. He was admitted into Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where he was diagnosed with COVID-19, put into an induced coma and placed on a ventilator. He was given blood thinners but developed clots and had his right leg amputated. He also underwent dialysis, was placed on a heart-lung bypass machine, was given a temporary pacemaker, had mini-strokes and sepsis, and lost more than 60 pounds. Kloots told Gayle King on CBS This Morning in early July that Cordero's lungs were so damaged he'd likely need a double lung transplant to survive.  Cordero was born in Hamilton, Ontario in 1978. He came to the U.S. to star in a musical called The Toxic Avenger. He was cast in the national tour of Rock of Ages and joined the Broadway production in 2012. Two years later, he played a mobster with playwrighting skills in the stage adaptation of Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway, where he became friends with actor Zach Braff.   Cordero, his wife and son were staying at Braff's guest house in L.A., when Cordero fell ill.  On Sunday, Braff posted on Instagram: ""I have honestly never known a kinder person.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images                    The mayor of Miami-Dade County has ordered a rollback of some reopening measures as Florida continues to see a surge in COVID-19 cases. Florida's Department of Health reported 6,336 new cases Monday, bringing the total to 206,447 people who have tested positive for the coronavirus.  While the number of new cases is lower than that seen over the weekend, fewer tests were also completed. On Saturday, Florida set a new record with 11,458 positive cases out of more than 85,000 people tested. Monday's results show just over 46-thousand people tested. But, the percentage of people testing positive for the virus remains about the same as the past week, near 15%.   In response, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez announced a new emergency order Monday closing restaurants to all except takeout and delivery. The order also closes gyms, fitness centers, party venues and short-term rentals. The action comes less than three weeks after restaurants were allowed to resume serving customers on the premises with safety precautions in place. In a statement, Gimenez said he was issuing the order because the county was seeing an increase in hospitalizations for COVID-19. He said, ""We want to ensure that our hospitals continue to have the staffing necessary to save lives.""   It follows emergency orders issued in Miami-Dade County last week that imposed a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and which closed the beaches for the holiday weekend. Gimenez says beaches will reopen Tuesday and outdoor activities, such as summer camps, can go forward with capacity limits and safety precautions in place.  Coronavirus Live Updates Another Day, Another Coronavirus Record In FloridaLike many parts of the country, Florida is seeing a surge in the number of cases involving young people in their 20's and 30's. In Miami-Dade County, Gimenez says too many young people are going to congested places without wearing face coverings or observing social distancing. He says, ""Contributing to the positives in that age group, the doctors have told me, were graduation parties, gatherings at restaurants that turned into packed parties in violation of the rules and street protests where people could not maintain social distancing and where not everyone was wearing facial coverings."" As cases have increased in Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis has resisted calls for him to take a more aggressive approach such as imposing a statewide mandate to require face coverings. On Monday, he downplayed concerns about the rising numbers. ""We've got all hands on deck. And I think the people of Florida are responding positively,"" he said. ""There's no need to be fearful. Let's just focus on the facts."" DeSantis said his administration is focusing on protecting the most vulnerable, namely people in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. The state is now requiring workers at those facilities, nearly 200-thousand statewide, to be tested for the virus every two weeks. More than half the COVID-19 fatalities in Florida have been among residents in long-term care facilities. As for the surge in cases among young people, DeSantis asked that it be kept in perspective. ""The number one age for cases in Florida is 21,"" he said. ""And if you're 21 and you don't have significant co-morbidities, your fatality rate is pretty much zero."" The governor said, ""To me, that's comforting to know...that it's affecting folks that are less likely to see clinical consequences."""

Anita Snow/AP                    Arizona is one of just five states that has seen new coronavirus cases climb by the thousands each day in the past couple of weeks.  The state's governor, Republican Doug Ducey, in May lifted a stay-at-home order he put in place in March so the economy could begin reopening. But a week ago, Ducey ordered bars, gyms, movie theaters and water parks to shut down again for 30 days as daily caseloads topped 3,000. ""We sent a message that we had defeated COVID-19 and we had not,"" Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, a Democrat, tells NPR. ""We are really in a bad situation where we need more resources for our medical system and help with testing."" In May, Ducey tied the hands of mayors when he issued an executive order requiring Arizona cities and counties to abide by state-level guidelines and do nothing that ""conflicts with or is in addition to"" those restrictions. He relented in mid-June, allowing cities to impose their own facemask requirements if they desired. Phoenix, Arizona's most populous city, quickly did so.  Gallego talked with NPR's All Things Considered about local authority and what help is needed. Here are selected excerpts: Do you think [the governor ordering bars and gyms closed again is] going to be enough to reverse this trajectory that we're seeing now? I would like for mayors and city councils to have the tools to make decisions in our local community. For example, I'm concerned that there's still transmission incurring in packed restaurants. So could we move those to take-out? I also would really ask that every level of government help the city of Phoenix with testing. This weekend I was at a testing location where people were waiting in 110 degrees for hours and hours, eight hours in their car, running out of gasoline, desperate to get a test. I would love to see more support. With this major spike in new cases, how confident are you that Phoenix has enough, say, ICU beds to handle a surge of hospitalizations at this point? We are in a crisis situation with our health care. We have reached the level where over 90% of our ICU beds are in use. And we are quite worried that after the Fourth of July weekend, we will see another large growth in COVID-19 admissions to the hospital. So we are very worried about what's to come. I believe the worst is still ahead of us, which is scary because it's already at the level of care where people are being treated in hallways and nurses are coming in from other states. I don't want to say, though, that Phoenix is the only Arizona community that's suffering. Our Navajo Nation is among the hardest hit anywhere in the world. It's a tough situation in all corners of our community."

Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images                    Uber is buying the delivery app Postmates, bolstering its food-delivery business at a time when few people are hailing rides. The $2.65 billion all-stock deal is a sign of how Uber's business model has been turned upside down as customers have stayed home during the coronavirus pandemic. Demand for rides — by far Uber's biggest business — plunged 75% in the second quarter from a year ago, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told Wall Street analysts in a conference call on Monday discussing the deal.  The Coronavirus Crisis As Restaurants Across The Country Close Their Doors, Deliveries Pick UpIn contrast, orders for its Uber Eats food delivery service doubled during the same three-month period. ""Consumers and restaurants have been shifting towards delivery before COVID-19,"" Khosrowshahi said. ""But the pandemic has accelerated these trends, rapidly attracting new customers and restaurants."" While Uber Eats is already the second-largest food delivery service in the US, according to data from Edison Trends, Postmates has a strong hold in major Western markets, including Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas. Combined, Uber Eats and Postmates will have a 37% market share — narrowing in but still clearly behind the biggest app, DoorDash. It has 45% of the U.S. market.   Loading...  In a written announcement, Uber noted Postmates had strong relationships with small- and medium-sized restaurants. It said it will keep the Postmates app running even after the purchase is finalized. Khosrowshahi said Uber is looking to capitalize on surging demand for delivery of all kinds, noting that Postmates has pushed into delivering items such as alcohol, groceries and pharmacy items. ""The vision for us is to become an everyday service,"" he said. But the deal will not stop Uber, which continues to report large losses, from bleeding cash. It and rival food-delivery apps spend a lot on discounts to attract customers. The tough conditions in the food-delivery market have spurred a race for scale. Last month, Grubhub, the U.S.'s third-largest delivery app, was snapped up by Just Eat Takeaway, a European company, for $7.3 billion. Uber had considered buying Grubhub itself. Less than a year ago, DoorDash bought another smaller app, Caviar. ""There's a battle royale going on in food delivery,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. That battle, he added, is good news for customers' wallets, as the apps compete to offer lower prices.   The Coronavirus Crisis Restaurants Are Desperate — But You May Not Be Helping When You Use Delivery AppsBut some restaurants say they have been more hurt than helped by the growing popularity of delivery. Apps charge between 20% to 40% in commission per order. To help restaurants, several cities, from New York to Seattle, have set caps on how much the apps can charge to deliver meals. The impact on Uber drivers is not clear. Many have turned to food delivery during the pandemic to make up for the loss of rides, said Harry Campbell, a driver who runs the popular blog The Rideshare Guy. ""Our top content on the blog and on the YouTube channel is all food delivery,"" he said. ""Everyone is signing up or trying to understand it and the earnings potential."" Uber says the Postmates deal will help drivers by giving them another way to earn money when ride-hailing is slow. The company says drivers also can combine multiple deliveries in a single trip, increasing efficiency and earning more money per trip. But Campbell cautioned that the delivery boom is not a panacea for drivers whose income has been decimated by the pandemic. Many drivers are already feeling squeezed, he said, because transporting food brings in less money than transporting people. ""When you can go work for Uber Eats or DoorDash or Caviar or Postmates, you can kind of compare the various offers. You can see who's offering the best bonuses ... And you can kind of hold each company accountable,"" Campbell said. Consolidation ""means there will just be less options for [drivers] and likely earnings will suffer because of that,"" he added.

Sandy Huffaker/AFP via Getty Images                    As the coronavirus has spread to communities across the U.S., among its effects has been physical upheaval. People have moved from one place to another, or welcomed new members into their households, because of either the virus or its economic impacts. There have been many stories of young people moving back in with their parents, new couples moving in together, and New Yorkers leaving apartments for homes in the suburbs or countryside. But how common are such moves, really? According to a new Pew Research Center survey, 3% of U.S. adults moved permanently or temporarily due to the pandemic, and 6% had someone move into their household because of it. Among the young, the numbers shot way up: 9% of adults age 18-29 have moved due to the coronavirus.  ""But many more knew someone else who had moved,"" says D'Vera Cohn, a senior writer and editor at Pew who authored the study. ""So if you add up the number of adults who either knew someone who moved or moved themselves, about one in five U.S. adults did.""  Asian and Hispanic respondents were more likely – at 7% and 6% — than Black or white respondents – at 4% and 2% — to have moved. People had different reasons moving: some were pushed, some pulled. For 28%, reducing their risk of contracting the virus was the most important reason for the move. Another 23% were uprooted when their college campus closed. A fifth of movers wanted to be with family. Eight percent moved due to job loss, and another 10% had other financial reasons. Cohn says there was a small indication that education and income were a factor in whether someone moved, but the effect was more striking if you asked about knowing someone who moved. Those with more education and higher incomes tended to be more likely to know someone who had moved, and young adults knew more movers than older people did. But if evictions rise, that may affect the income levels of those moving in the months ahead. The survey, which was conducted in early June, didn't ask where people moved to or from, so the geographical result of so many moves is still unclear. U.S. Postal Service data from March and April showed that the New York City residents who submitted mail-forwarding requests had decamped for places like South Florida, Connecticut and Southern California. But the Pew survey does give some insight into the housing situations people are seeking amid the virus. About 61% of the adults moved in with a family member, while 13% moved to a second home or a vacation home. Others shelled out for a new spot: 9% rented or bought a place. It's too soon to tell, she says, just how many of these moves will be permanent. ""It may be that some people don't know yet because of the uncertainties about school and job work-from-home arrangements,"" says Cohn."

To compare state outbreaks, the trend lines for average new daily cases are graphed against each state's total case count to date. This highlights a state's daily growth relative to the overall size of its outbreak.  Shots - Health News What Do Coronavirus Racial Disparities Look Like State By State?  Shots - Health News As States Reopen, Do They Have The Workforce They Need To Stop Coronavirus Outbreaks?When both new and total case counts grow quickly, the curve bends upward. As cases slow, the curve levels or bends down. In New York, site of the country's largest outbreak, the state's curve rose sharply before reaching over 170,000 total cases in April. Since then, new cases have fallen from about 10,000 per day in mid-April to fewer than 700 per day in late June.   Some states, such as Hawaii, have declined to just a dozen new cases per day, while others are growing. Arizona, which had leveled off at around 15,000 total cases in May, saw a sudden sharp spike in new cases in June.  Loading...  The coronavirus has hit some states much harder than others. For much of the pandemic, a large share of U.S. cases have been centered around New York City. As of early June, New York state, Connecticut and New Jersey accounted for about 30% of total cases in the nation and 42% of deaths, although new cases have been dropping in these three states. Across the country, other large, populous states such as California, Illinois and Texas have high totals as well. Some smaller states have had a heavy burden of disease relative to their population size, such as Nebraska and Iowa, which have high case counts per capita, and Louisiana and Michigan which have a high death count per capita.

The JHU team automates its data uploads and regularly checks them for anomalies. This may result in occasional data discrepancies on this page as the JHU team resolves anomalies and updates its feeds. State-by-state recovery data are unavailable at this time. There may be discrepancies between what you see here and what you see on your local health department's website. Figures shown do not include cases on cruise ships. In early June, Michigan health authorities started including probable cases in its totals. This resulted in a brief spike in the state's daily numbers until the JHU team was able to reconcile the historical data. On June 25, New Jersey included 1,854 previously-unreported probable deaths in its totals, resulting in a spike in the state's daily death numbers.

They lined up in vehicles last week in a Phoenix neighborhood.

They lined up in vehicles last week in a Phoenix neighborhood.                        Matt York/AP                    Across the United States the coronavirus is once again on the march. On Wednesday alone there were nearly 50,000 new cases — a record. The case counts for each state suggest the disease is mainly spreading in a band stretching from Florida across much of the southernmost states and westward to California, with Idaho and Iowa also in trouble. But when you use tools to drill down to more local data, the picture gets more complicated — and even more concerning. Here are five takeaways:  Shots - Health News Green, Yellow, Orange Or Red? This New Tool Shows COVID-19 Risk In Your CountyIt may be time for a statewide lockdown in Arizona and Florida  A key measure that epidemiologists track is the number of new coronavirus cases each day as a percentage of the population. (This per capita approach is key because it flags less populous locations that may have a large amount of spread relative to their size — and potentially more cases than their health systems are set up to deal with.) This week a team led by researchers at Harvard came up with a rating tool with four tiers: The highest ""red"" alert level — triggered if a location has more than 25 new cases per day per 100,000 people — means the virus is spreading to such a degree that evidence suggests the only way to get a handle on it is to revert to stay-at-home mode. At this stage even less drastic measures such as massively ramped-up testing and contact tracing probably won't cut it. Technically, three states currently fall in this category: Arizona, Florida and South Carolina. But use the tool to check the situation at the county level, and the virus's reach through Arizona in particular becomes apparent. Nearly two-thirds of the state's counties are in the red zone — compared with about a third of South Carolina's counties.  ""I'm very worried about Arizona,"" says Thomas Tsai, one of the Harvard professors who put together the tool. ""We knew about the outbreak in Navajo Nation. And now we're seeing that that entire northeast corner of Arizona, and realistically, most of Arizona, is becoming red and poses a risk of the pandemic growing out of proportion."" Florida concerns him for the same reason. ""Before the focus was really on the metropolitan areas around Miami,"" Tsai says. ""But now we're seeing that counties in central Florida and even some counties in the panhandle — which had relatively few cases early on in the pandemic — are seeing an escalating rise in cases."" There's trouble in Texas On the one hand Texas offers a sharp contrast. For now, transmission is mainly occurring in the state's large cities, notes Marynia Kolak, leader of a University of Chicago team that has created another tool with county-level data. ""So they have the potential to contain the outbreak before it continues,"" Kolak says. But by another measure Texas is in major trouble. A team from Dartmouth has created a tool that tracks not just how many new cases local areas are seeing per day but how quickly the overall caseload is rising each week. And the top three localities are in Texas — including the Corpus Christi area, where cases rose more than 15% over the past week. (Technically the Dartmouth tool divides areas not by county, but by communities using the same set of hospitals.) Corpus Christi also ranks in the top 10 when it comes to daily new case counts per capita. ""It's a double whammy,"" says Elliott Fisher, who spearheaded the Dartmouth tool. ""It's a place with one of the highest number of new cases and the highest growth rate. So they really need to get their act together."" Other localities in this double-whammy category that he points to include the Victoria and Austin areas in Texas, and — in Florida — Tampa, Miami, Orlando and Jacksonville. Hot spots are cropping up in otherwise better-off states The local-level tools also highlight flare-ups in counties that would otherwise be overlooked because they are in states where the overall spread is not as serious. ""A cluster has to be pretty severe in order for the state to emerge as a hot spot,"" the University of Chicago's Kolak says. Yet the history of the pandemic thus far has shown that isolated flare-ups can eventually widen out with catastrophic consequences. ""Sometimes those progress and grow into larger clusters. Sometimes they don't. So we consider those areas potential emerging risks."" Harvard's Tsai points to Yakima County in Washington state as one that concerns him. Other examples include counties in California and Iowa. But it's worth noting that the vast majority of counties in the Harvard group's red zone are not in the three red zone states. State borders pose a challenge The Chicago group's tool also includes a feature that surfaces emerging regional clusters by identifying counties where the daily per capita new case number is high both there and in neighboring counties. ""What this shows is not just hot spots at a state level, but you start to notice that there's a lot of hot spots occurring along the borders of states,"" Kolak says. Examples include between Southern California and Arizona as well as along the Mississippi River — with cases high in both the Memphis, Tenn., area and across the border in Arkansas. This border issue points up a challenge for states, Kolak says. ""There's definite concern there, because unless you have a federally coordinated response, anything that one of those states does may not necessarily have a full impact unless the nearby states also agree."" The choices that citizens make also play into this, she says. ""So for example, if you're in a state that has very strict social distancing guidelines, but the state next to you has very relaxed ones — driving [there] to get a haircut"" could foment cross-border spread. Ordinary citizens should check the county-level tools While the tools described are mainly helpful to scientists and policymakers trying to detect and respond to broader trends, all of us may benefit from checking them more or less the way we look at the weather report. Dartmouth's Fisher says looking up the new-daily-cases-per-capita measure is a proxy for checking, ""What is the likelihood that the person standing in line with you at a Starbucks [in your county] might give you COVID-19."" Chicago's Kolak agrees. The July Fourth celebrations are largely canceled in her area, she says. But she says she's worried by talk that many people are planning to travel to fireworks displays farther afield. Based on what her county-level mapping tool shows, ""I've been encouraging friends not to go to Iowa for the July [Fourth] fireworks,"" she says. ""In some of those areas, cases are still pretty low. But there are counties that are starting to persistently get flagged as high relative to the nearby areas."""

Jump to a State: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, other states  Connecticut Status of Stay-at-Home order     Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order directing Connecticut residents to ""Stay Safe, Stay at Home"" beginning March 23. Lamont extended the stay-at-home order until May 20 and outlined a phased-in approach to reopening beginning on that date. An executive order requires the use of cloth face coverings in public ""wherever close contact is unavoidable,"" including while using public transit and ride-sharing services, beginning April 20.  Reopening  The governors of Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Delaware announced on April 13 the creation of a multi-state council that will develop a regional framework for safely and gradually lifting stay-at-home orders and restoring the economy. On May 7, Lamont announced the state must meet seven criteria in order to enter the first phase of reopening. On May 9, Lamont released specific rules that businesses eligible to reopen under Phase 1 must follow. He stressed that individual business owners can choose whether to open.   In Phase 1, restaurants can reopen outdoor seating only, at limited capacity and with social distancing measures in place. Offices can open at limited capacity, though working from home remains encouraged whenever possible. Retail stores and malls can allow some walk-ins, with safety parameters in place. Museums and zoos can open outdoor exhibits at up to 50% capacity. Businesses eligible to open in Phase 1 must self-certify that they will comply with state rules and regulations. On May 20, the state entered Phase 1 of reopening, which allows certain sectors of the economy to reopen, including retail and malls, outdoor dining, offices and outdoor recreation businesses. An executive order extended the prohibition on large gatherings and restrictions on indoor fitness and movie theaters to June 20. Lamont issued an executive order allowing restaurants, wineries, breweries and bars to deliver directly to homes. State statutes have been modified to suspend the delivery signature requirement. The governors of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut announced that marinas, boatyards and marine manufacturers in their states can operate for personal use as long as strict social distancing and sanitation protocols are upheld. A May 12 executive order helps expedite various approval processes so that restaurants can expand their outdoor dining areas. It also allows retail stores to get fast-tracked permission to sell goods in certain outdoor spaces, including on sidewalks. The state released guidance for dentist offices considering resuming elective services after May 20. State parks with beaches along the Connecticut shoreline opened with capacity limitations on May 22, as part of a regional agreement. The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection released an operations plan for state park grounds, trails, beaches and boat launches heading into the summer season. State campgrounds, cabins, youth sites and river camping sites are closed until at least June 11. Summer camps can open as June 29, in compliance with forthcoming state guidance. Barber shops and hair salons can resume operations as of June 1. Effective June 1, limits on social and recreational gatherings are raised to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors. Religious and spiritual gathering limits are raised to 25% of indoor venue capacity or a maximum of 100 people, whichever is smaller, and 150 people outdoors. Two tribal casinos resumed limited operations on June 1, though Lamont said he thought it was too early. A June 2 executive order increases the number of children that a child care program can serve during the emergency without needing Office of Early Childhood approval from 30 to 50. Outdoor, in-person graduation ceremonies can be held in line with specific guidelines starting July 6. The state released requirements for superintendents regarding the optional reopening of in-person summer school, beginning no earlier than July 6. The Connecticut Judicial Branch announced plans to resume limited operations in three courthouses, beyond the 10 that never closed, on June 8. Starting the week of June 29, limited operations will resume at an additional four courthouses, bringing the total number of open courthouses to 17. Beginning the week of July 6, all operating courthouse locations are open to the public from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. By July 20, a total of 25 courthouses will be operational. Phase 2 of reopening began on June 17. In Phase 2, additional businesses can choose to resume operations in compliance with sector-specific regulations. Sectors allowed to reopen include amusement parks, hotels, libraries, sports and fitness facilities, personal care services, outdoor events, indoor museums, zoos and aquariums, indoor recreation venues and indoor restaurant dining. As of June 17, indoor gathering limits increased to 25 people, outdoor gathering limits increased to 100 and outdoor event venues such as amphitheaters and race tracks can accommodate 25% of their fire capacity with social distancing. Effective July 3, one-time outdoor graduation ceremonies of up to 150 people are allowed. Outdoor organized gatherings such as fireworks and concerts can have a cap of 500 people as long as there are 15 feet of space between blankets. In mid-July, indoor gatherings will be able to increase to 50 people, outdoor gatherings can expand to 250 people, outdoor event venues can expand to 50% capacity and outdoor organized gatherings will have no cap but must enforce social distancing. State campgrounds will open for the season on July 8. Campers can make reservations online beginning June 20. The state's two river ferry services resumed on June 20. The Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles reopened select offices on June 23, and is offering in-person services — including road tests — by appointment only. Lamont announced a detailed framework for reopening all school districts to full-time, in-person instruction for the 2020-2021 academic year.   Closed, canceled and delayed  In-person classes at K-12 schools will remain canceled for the rest of the academic year, Lamont announced on May 5. Schools must continue providing meals to children under lunch and breakfast programs for consumption at home. The state's 2020 presidential primary election has been rescheduled a second time, to August 11. The governors of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York announced a joint travel advisory, effective 11:59 p.m. on June 24, requiring all individuals coming from designated states with significant community spread to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. Lamont announced an update to the travel advisory on July 2, allowing travelers to enter the state without having to quarantine if they test negative within 72 hours prior to arrival.  Testing and tracing   Lamont is encouraging Connecticut residents to self-report their daily symptoms through the ""How We Feel"" app to anonymously provide critical public health information to the medical community. An initiative between Hartford HealthCare and Quest Diagnostics, announced April 21, will increase the state's testing capacity from 500 to 2,500 COVID-19 tests per day. Lamont's administration increased access to COVID-19 testing by suspending two regulations: patients no longer need a referral from a medical provider, and pharmacists can now order and administer tests. A June 1 executive order mandates COVID-19 testing for staff of private and municipal nursing homes, managed residential communities and assisted living services agencies. It was later modified to allow facilities to cease testing after 14 consecutive days with no positive cases, with testing required to resume if a worker or resident tests positive. Lamont announced that the state, working with Yale University and other partners, will conduct a study of 1,400 randomized, representative residents using blood samples to identify people who have developed COVID-19 antibodies, in an effort to quantify the spread of the virus statewide.  Relief and resources  Lamont says the state's small businesses and nonprofits impacted by the virus may apply for ""one-year, no-interest loans of up to $75,000."" Lamont issued an executive order on April 7 permitting recent graduates of medical school and ""other medical profession graduates"" who are not yet licensed to begin practicing. It also permits practice before licensure for mental health counselor associates and marital and family therapy associates. An April 10 executive order issues protections for residential renters impacted by the pandemic for the duration of the public health emergency. The Connecticut Department of Revenue Services is extending the filing and payment deadlines for certain tax returns until July 15. The Connecticut Insurance Department said all fully-insured health plan members can now receive COVID-19 testing and treatment with no out-of-pocket costs. Lamont is expanding Medicaid payments to nursing homes across the state by 15 percent, constituting $65 million to be used for coronavirus-related costs. The state Department of Public Health will make on-site visits to all 215 facilities to conduct infection control surveys. A multi-state initiative will expand payment relief for people with private and non-federal student loans, which are not covered by the CARES Act. The agreement expands protections to student loan borrowers in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. The state received a $2 million federal grant to support mental health services, which it will use to launch the Connecticut COVID-19 Behavioral Health Response and Assistance initiative. Lamont and the Connecticut Business and Industry Association are distributing free face coverings to eligible, designated small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. Connecticut is authorized to provide $72.3 million in SNAP benefits to children eligible for free and reduced-price school meals, as part of the new Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer program. The Connecticut Office of Early Childhood launched the CTCARES for Frontline Workers Program, which expands access to child care for eligible front-line workers by paying subsidies directly to care providers. The Connecticut Judicial Branch announced that parties who have an agreement may have their family court cases resolved remotely. On May 3, the governors of Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Delaware announced a multi-state agreement to develop a regional supply chain for personal protective equipment, medical equipment and testing. The regional purchasing initiative aims to increase market power and prevent price gouging. Additional SNAP benefits went to nearly 100,000 eligible households in May, and to more than 108,000 eligible households in June. The state will provide $95.5 million in SNAP benefits to families of children eligible for free and reduced-price school meals through the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer program. Lamont announced that residents who have been financially impacted by COVID-19 can receive free assistance managing their student loans through Summer, a resource for borrowers. While visitation to nursing homes is prohibited, an order implements standards to ensure residents can speak with their families through window visits or virtual conferencing. Lamont announced on May 12 that the state had received its single largest shipment of personal protective equipment to date from China. The supply will be distributed to front-line workers, and includes 6 million surgical masks, 500,000 protective masks, 100,000 surgical gowns and 100,000 temporal thermometers. The state is receiving $111 million in federal relief aid to help school districts provide continued learning and address coronavirus-related disruptions. The state Department of Education will allocate funding based on need. The state is distributing 50,000 infrared thermometers to small businesses, nonprofits and places of worship. An executive order allows all registered voters to vote absentee in the August 11 primary. The secretary of the state said she intends to mail every registered voter an absentee ballot application. The state implemented SNAP online food purchasing at participating retailers beginning June 2 and 3. The Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles is extending expiration dates by 180 days for licenses, permits, registrations, identification cards and other credentials with original expiration dates between March 10 and June 30. The Connecticut Superior Court ordered a stay of all issued executions on evictions and ejectments through July 1. The utility shutoff moratorium for non-residential customers will continue through July 1. The utility shutoff moratorium for residential customers will continue for the duration of the public health emergency. Lamont announced the state is partnering with philanthropic organizations to provide assistance to vulnerable residents who are impacted by the pandemic but otherwise ineligible for federal pandemic relief programs, including members of the undocumented community. Banks and credit unions are extending their participation in the Connecticut Mortgage Relief Program through July 30. Lamont announced the creation of the Connecticut Municipal Coronavirus Relief Fund Program, which will reimburse cities and towns for pandemic-related expenses. The new CT Back to Work Initiative will provide workers and businesses with career tools, including a customized state job portal, virtual job fair and online workforce training courses. Lamont announced a $33 million plan to provide emergency assistance to renters, homeowners and residential landlords impacted by the pandemic. Lamont extended the moratorium on residential evictions through August 22.   Shots - Health News Tracking The Pandemic: How Quickly Is The Coronavirus Spreading State By State? Maine Status of Stay-at-Home order    Gov. Janet Mills issued an order directing residents to ""stay at home at all times unless for an essential job or an essential personal reason, such as obtaining food, medicine, health care, or other necessary purposes"" until at least April 30. A modified stay-at-home order extended through May 31. Certain businesses in select rural counties could reopen before then. Individuals must maintain a 6-foot distance from others when in public, and are now required to wear cloth face coverings in public settings where physical distancing measures are hard to maintain, including at outdoor gatherings. Businesses must post signs alerting customers of the face covering requirement by June 5, and may deny entry to people who do not comply. An executive order effective June 1 continues the ""Stay Safer at Home"" order but allows people to venture out for more businesses and activities as they reopen.  Reopening  On April 28, Mills introduced a modified stay-at-home order effective through May 31 and introduced a plan to gradually lift certain restrictions. The plan establishes four stages, starting with resuming low-risk business operations. It's designed to progress on a month-by-month basis depending on the success of each step. The first stage started May 1. As of May 1, some business and quality of life activities can resume with specific limits and safety precautions in place. They include: personal care services, drive-in religious services, drive-in movie theaters, auto dealerships and car washes, and most state parks and historic sites. Guided outdoor activities like hunting and fishing, as well as restricted use of golf and disc golf courses, are permitted. Retail stores can offer curbside pickup. Also starting May 1, state-licensed health care providers can resume operations if they implement certain protocols and maintain capacity for potential outbreaks. Mills announced a rural reopening plan for the resumption of certain services and activities in 12 counties where community transmission is not believed to be present. Retail stores can reopen as of May 11, with added health and safety precautions. Restaurants there can reopen beginning May 18 with additional precautions. Also on that day, remote campsites and sporting camps in these counties can reopen with public health safeguards, only to Maine residents or those who have completed a 14-day quarantine. Statewide as of May 11, fitness and exercise gyms can reopen for outdoor classes capped at 10 people and one-on-one personal training indoors. Effective May 14, Maine lodging providers can begin accepting reservations for stays with an arrival date of June 1 or later for Maine residents and non-residents who comply with the state's two week self-quarantine mandate. Lodging establishments must ""be prepared"" to cancel and fully refund reservations if they cannot open under Stage 2. Campgrounds and RV parks opened to Maine residents only on May 22. The state moved into Stage 2 of reopening on June 1. Counties that have not already reopened retail businesses to indoor shopping can do so voluntarily with strict precautions. Another county can join the 12 rural counties that allow restaurants to open for outdoor and indoor dining, and three counties can reopen restaurants for outdoor dining only. The limit on gatherings has increased from 10 to 50 people. An executive order effective June 1 removes the distinction between essential and nonessential businesses in line with the restarting plan. All workplaces are encouraged to keep employees working remotely to the extent practicable. Public transportation should only be used for essential purposes, and people traveling in private vehicles must limit passengers to their household members. Interstate travel restrictions remain in effect. Under the rural reopening plan, 13 of Maine's 16 counties can open gyms, fitness centers, nail salons and tattoo and piercing establishments beginning June 12. Bars and tasting rooms in those counties will also be able to open for outdoor service. Mills announced the ""Keep Maine Healthy"" plan, a three-fold approach to protecting residents and visitors that involves testing as an alternative to self-quarantine, increased symptom checking and state support for local public health and COVID-19 prevention efforts. Visitors with proof of a recent negative test result do not have to quarantine upon arrival, and residents of New Hampshire and Vermont are exempt from this requirement altogether. Mills announced that visitors from Connecticut, New York and New Jersey are exempt from the state's quarantine requirement and testing alternative effective July 3. Mills announced that lodging establishments can begin serving out-of-state residents who meet the 14-day quarantine or alternative testing requirement beginning June 26, moved up from July 1. Residents of New Hampshire and Vermont can stay at Maine lodging establishments as of June 12. State officials released guidance for town meetings and elections during the pandemic, with two options for conducting meetings that exceed the 50-person gathering limit as well as hygiene and social distancing protocols for polling places. Effective June 17, the remaining three counties are allowed to reopen indoor dining with additional health and safety protocols. They can also open bars, breweries and tasting rooms for outdoor, seated service. Gyms, tattoo parlors and nail salons can open in line with requirements. Capacity limits at retail establishments expands to allow up to 5 customers per 1,000 square feet. Officials released COVID-19 prevention checklists for establishments opening in Stage 3, including spas, indoor and outdoor amusements, movie theaters and performing arts venues.  Closed, canceled and delayed  Maine's primary election has been rescheduled to July 14. Applications for absentee ballots can be made, without specifying a reason, up to and including the day of the election. Mills instructed all state government departments to freeze non-emergency spending and hiring and prohibited state employees from traveling outside of Maine on government business. The Mills administration said it does not anticipate accepting cruise or commercial passenger ships with more than 50 people this summer, excluding passenger ferries working between Maine ports. Mills announced that indoor bar service, tentatively scheduled to reopen on July 1, is postponed ""until further notice.""  Testing and tracing  Through a partnership with Maine-based IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Mills' administration is purchasing enough COVID-19 testing kits to ""more than triple"" the state's testing capacity. Mills said the state is purchasing enough test kits to run at least 5,000 tests per week ""for the foreseeable future."" As of May 18, Maine has eliminated its testing prioritization system and is allowing health care providers to seek testing for anyone suspected of having COVID-19, including individuals showing symptoms or those who have had close contact with a confirmed case. Mills announced that the state is expanding its contact tracing efforts by enlisting more staff and volunteers, deploying new technology and expanding social supports for individuals self-quarantining because of exposure. Mills announced that starting in July, the state will ""quadruple"" its COVID-19 lab testing capacity, develop an additional 20 ""swab and send"" testing locations and allow more people with elevated risk of exposure to get tested.  Relief and resources  The state legislature approved Gov. Mills' emergency package worth roughly $11 million that expands eligibility for unemployment benefits and prohibits utilities from terminating residential electric and water service. Mills issued an executive order on April 7 that expands access to health care by allowing licensed social workers, psychologists and physical therapists to provide services via telehealth. It also allows certain health care providers like respiratory therapists and pharmacists to receive temporary licenses to provide care if licensed in another state, or reactivate their Maine license if retired within the last three years. Preparation is underway to open two alternative care sites in Portland and Bangor. An April 16 executive order limits evictions during the state of emergency. Mills announced a rental assistance relief program for people affected by COVID-19. Eligible households will receive a one-time payment up to $500 that will be paid directly to their landlord. The program has since been extended to cover rent for April, May or June. Maine received nearly $11 million in federal funds to support access to child care for essential workers and offer relief to child care providers affected by the pandemic. The state launched its ""FrontLine WarmLine,"" a volunteer phone support service to help health care workers and first responders manage stress. Mills has postponed the deadline for estimated second quarter state income tax payments from June 15 to July 15, in alignment with the federal due date. Maine's income tax return filing deadline has also been extended to July 15. Mills extended Maine's state of civil emergency a third time, through July 10, allowing the state to continue accessing federal resources. Through federal funding and private donations, Mills' administration secured internet access and learning devices for ""100 percent of Maine school children for whom there was a reported need."" The state provided 1,900 cloth face coverings to the Maine Association of Broadcasters, for use by broadcast media outlet employees. The state received $52.7 million in federal funding, which will be used primarily to expand laboratory capacity, particularly at rural hospitals, and establish more drive-through testing sites. The state Department of Health and Human Services distributed nearly $11 million in CARES Act funding in the form of child care subsidies for 525 essential workers and stipends for more than 1,600 child care providers.

Maine Status of Stay-at-Home order    Gov. Janet Mills issued an order directing residents to ""stay at home at all times unless for an essential job or an essential personal reason, such as obtaining food, medicine, health care, or other necessary purposes"" until at least April 30. A modified stay-at-home order extended through May 31. Certain businesses in select rural counties could reopen before then. Individuals must maintain a 6-foot distance from others when in public, and are now required to wear cloth face coverings in public settings where physical distancing measures are hard to maintain, including at outdoor gatherings. Businesses must post signs alerting customers of the face covering requirement by June 5, and may deny entry to people who do not comply. An executive order effective June 1 continues the ""Stay Safer at Home"" order but allows people to venture out for more businesses and activities as they reopen.  Reopening  On April 28, Mills introduced a modified stay-at-home order effective through May 31 and introduced a plan to gradually lift certain restrictions. The plan establishes four stages, starting with resuming low-risk business operations. It's designed to progress on a month-by-month basis depending on the success of each step. The first stage started May 1. As of May 1, some business and quality of life activities can resume with specific limits and safety precautions in place. They include: personal care services, drive-in religious services, drive-in movie theaters, auto dealerships and car washes, and most state parks and historic sites. Guided outdoor activities like hunting and fishing, as well as restricted use of golf and disc golf courses, are permitted. Retail stores can offer curbside pickup. Also starting May 1, state-licensed health care providers can resume operations if they implement certain protocols and maintain capacity for potential outbreaks. Mills announced a rural reopening plan for the resumption of certain services and activities in 12 counties where community transmission is not believed to be present. Retail stores can reopen as of May 11, with added health and safety precautions. Restaurants there can reopen beginning May 18 with additional precautions. Also on that day, remote campsites and sporting camps in these counties can reopen with public health safeguards, only to Maine residents or those who have completed a 14-day quarantine. Statewide as of May 11, fitness and exercise gyms can reopen for outdoor classes capped at 10 people and one-on-one personal training indoors.

Lodging establishments must ""be prepared"" to cancel and fully refund reservations if they cannot open under Stage 2. Campgrounds and RV parks opened to Maine residents only on May 22. The state moved into Stage 2 of reopening on June 1. Counties that have not already reopened retail businesses to indoor shopping can do so voluntarily with strict precautions. Another county can join the 12 rural counties that allow restaurants to open for outdoor and indoor dining, and three counties can reopen restaurants for outdoor dining only. The limit on gatherings has increased from 10 to 50 people. An executive order effective June 1 removes the distinction between essential and nonessential businesses in line with the restarting plan. All workplaces are encouraged to keep employees working remotely to the extent practicable. Public transportation should only be used for essential purposes, and people traveling in private vehicles must limit passengers to their household members. Interstate travel restrictions remain in effect. Under the rural reopening plan, 13 of Maine's 16 counties can open gyms, fitness centers, nail salons and tattoo and piercing establishments beginning June 12. Bars and tasting rooms in those counties will also be able to open for outdoor service. Mills announced the ""Keep Maine Healthy"" plan, a three-fold approach to protecting residents and visitors that involves testing as an alternative to self-quarantine, increased symptom checking and state support for local public health and COVID-19 prevention efforts. Visitors with proof of a recent negative test result do not have to quarantine upon arrival, and residents of New Hampshire and Vermont are exempt from this requirement altogether. Mills announced that visitors from Connecticut, New York and New Jersey are exempt from the state's quarantine requirement and testing alternative effective July 3. Mills announced that lodging establishments can begin serving out-of-state residents who meet the 14-day quarantine or alternative testing requirement beginning June 26, moved up from July 1.

Testing and tracing  Through a partnership with Maine-based IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Mills' administration is purchasing enough COVID-19 testing kits to ""more than triple"" the state's testing capacity. Mills said the state is purchasing enough test kits to run at least 5,000 tests per week ""for the foreseeable future."" As of May 18, Maine has eliminated its testing prioritization system and is allowing health care providers to seek testing for anyone suspected of having COVID-19, including individuals showing symptoms or those who have had close contact with a confirmed case.

Mills announced that starting in July, the state will ""quadruple"" its COVID-19 lab testing capacity, develop an additional 20 ""swab and send"" testing locations and allow more people with elevated risk of exposure to get tested.  Relief and resources  The state legislature approved Gov. Mills' emergency package worth roughly $11 million that expands eligibility for unemployment benefits and prohibits utilities from terminating residential electric and water service. Mills issued an executive order on April 7 that expands access to health care by allowing licensed social workers, psychologists and physical therapists to provide services via telehealth.

Gina Raimondo ordered Rhode Island residents to stay at home ""unless traveling to work, traveling for medical treatment or obtaining necessities."" She extended this and other restrictions through May 8. The state entered Phase 1 of its reopening plan on May 9, and began Phase 2 on June 1. An executive order effective May 8 requires individuals to wear masks or cloth face coverings in indoor and outdoor public settings, unless they can ""easily, continuously, and measurably"" maintain at least 6 feet of distance from others. It also requires face coverings to be worn inside retail stores and while using car services and mass public transit. On June 4, Raimondo extended the order for an additional month. She has since extended it to August 3.  Reopening  The governors of Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Delaware announced on April 13 the creation of a multi-state council that will develop a regional framework for safely and gradually lifting stay-at-home orders and restoring the economy. On May 4, Raimondo released additional information about Phase 1 conditions. Though the stay-at-home order will lift, people are encouraged to remain close to home. Anyone who can continue teleworking is directed to do so, and employees who must work in offices can do so on a limited basis. Elective medical procedures can resume under safety guidelines. Non-critical retailers can reopen with capacity restrictions. In Phase 1, residents are encouraged to stay close to home, but some non-critical retailers, state parks and offices can resume limited operations.

Drive-in services are allowed as long as individuals remain in their cars, and funerals can have a maximum of 10 people with appropriate social distancing. Raimondo signed an executive order requiring client-facing businesses and nonprofits to provide face coverings to all employees, to be worn in the workplace with few exceptions. Businesses must also direct customers to wear face coverings. The order is effective April 18, and compliance will be monitored through Department of Business Regulation spot checks. Raimondo announced that restaurants can offer limited outdoor dining beginning May 18. The Department of Environmental Management is reopening Rhode Island's state parks ""in a graduated manner"" during Phase 1. It will reduce the size of parking areas and restrict hours of operation and permitted activities in order to prevent crowds. Certain parks reopened for day use on May 9. Visitors must bring face coverings, and indoor spaces, playgrounds and athletic fields are closed. Raimondo announced that two state beaches would open with restrictions on May 25. The state released guidelines allowing in-person faith services to resume the weekend of May 30. Houses of worship are limited to 25% of their overall capacity.  In Phase 1, many libraries offered curbside pickup of pre-ordered books. In Phase 2, they can introduce limited, touchless browsing in designated areas. In-library services will be provided in adherence to state regulations for sanitation and social distancing. In Phase 2 of reopening, social gatherings of up to 15 people are allowed, and certain travel restrictions are relaxed. State parks and beaches can open with restrictions. Indoor restaurant dining, personal care services, malls, gyms and certain outdoor activities will be allowed to reopen with restrictions. Non-critical retailers can relax certain restrictions, and office-based businesses are encouraged to continue telework policies but can allow up to 33% of their workforce to return ""if viewed as necessary.""   In Phase 2, all state parks and beaches can reopen with restrictions. Child care services can resume in ""small, stable groups"" effective June 1. The state released guidance for the limited resumption of youth sports activities beginning June 1. The state is allowing summer camps and youth summer programs to operate in person under strict regulations beginning June 29. Camps must limit groups to 15 people and follow other sanitation and social distancing guidelines. Raimondo announced a goal of returning to full in-person school in the fall, and said all public school districts will use the same base statewide calendar with a targeted in-person start date of August 31. She said each district will have to submit scenario-specific plans for operating fully in-person, entirely through distance learning and with a hybrid of the two. State officials released school reopening guidance for the 2020-2021 academic year. In Phase 3, businesses and places of public interaction can expand their operating capacity as long as 6-foot spacing is maintained. Indoor venues can increase up to 66% capacity or up to 1 person per 100 square feet. Indoor assembly venues must submit a plan if they wish to host more than 250 people, and large outdoor venues may have to submit plans for approval, with groups of more than 250 people in outdoor places of public interaction discouraged. Parking restrictions at state beaches eased the weekend of June 26, increasing parking to 75% capacity. Passes must be purchased online in advance. The state entered Phase 3 on June 30, with updated gathering limits. Social gatherings will be limited to 25 people indoors and 50 people outdoors. Weddings with licensed caterers can have 50 people indoors and 100 people outdoors. Long-term care and assisted living facilities can resume limited visitation beginning July 8.

She said it is unlikely that weddings with more than 50 guests can take place in June or July. Night club operations remain closed in Phase 3.  Testing and tracing  Raimondo announced the launch of the first version of CRUSH COVID RI, a mobile app with coronavirus-related news and resources including a symptom checker and optional location diary. The governor is encouraging Rhode Islanders to use the app and offer feedback. An April 9 executive order issues stricter self-quarantine and self-isolation rules for any who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 or in close contact with a confirmed positive case. It also authorizes the health department to make and enforce additional rules, including through civil penalties. Raimondo said authorities could issue fines in ""the hundreds of dollars range"" to those who violate quarantine rules. Effective June 8, the state is expanding testing eligibility to include asymptomatic child care employees and close-contact workers at salons, barber shops, gyms and tattoo, massage and tanning establishments. Anyone who has attended a protest can get tested, regardless of symptoms. The state's asymptomatic testing program later expanded to include restaurant workers and bus drivers. On June 17, Raimondo announced four additional appointment-only testing sites for asymptomatic individuals.

An April 27 executive order relaxes regulations and eliminates certain barriers to health care for one month. On May 3, the governors of Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Delaware announced a multi-state agreement to develop a regional supply chain for personal protective equipment, medical equipment and testing. The regional purchasing initiative aims to increase market power and prevent price gouging. Eligible SNAP households not already receiving the maximum benefit amount received additional benefits in March, April and May. The state made an initial $1.5 million in emergency rental assistance available to low-income renters who are at immediate risk of homelessness. Qualifying individuals will receive a grant of up to $5,000 to support past due rent payments and other expenditures. Raimondo later announced an additional $5 million for the fund. Rhode Island is partnering with the social enterprise Summer to provide free student loan assistance for all residents financially impacted by the pandemic. The executive order implementing Phase 1 of reopening says that health and safety regulations can include enforcement provisions, like civil fines, to ensure compliance. It establishes an enforcement task force that will educate and inspect businesses, governmental entities and other establishments. The task force's mandate continues in Phase 2.

Raimondo said she will extend several executive orders set to expire in July until August 3, including gun background checks and quarantine rules.   Vermont Status of Stay-at-Home order    Gov. Phil Scott issued a ""Stay Home, Stay Safe"" order effective March 25, which directed Vermonters to leave their residences only for essential reasons and to adhere to social distancing policies while in public.

Scott announced on May 4 that limited elective procedures could resume. Health care providers may perform nonessential outpatient clinic visits, diagnostic imaging and outpatient surgeries if they follow specific protocols. On May 6, Scott announced that some outdoor recreation and limited social interactions could resume with specific health and safety precautions. Vermonters are now permitted to leave home for outdoor recreation and fitness activities with low or no direct contact. Gatherings of 10 or fewer are permitted, preferably outdoors. Members of one household can gather with members of ""another trusted household.""

Jump to a state: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, other states  Alabama Status of Stay-at-Home order   Gov. Kay Ivey issued a statewide stay-at-home order effective April 4 through April 30. The order mandated people stay in their place of residence except for performing specific essential activities, closed nonessential businesses and required those still operating on-site to implement social distancing measures. The latest amended Safer at Home order is in effect statewide from 5:00 p.m. on May 22 to 5:00 p.m. on July 31.  Reopening  The latest Safer at Home order allows additional activities and establishments to open in line with social distancing and sanitation rules. Those include athletic activities, educational institutions, child care facilities, summer camps and entertainment venues such as arcades, theaters and bowling alleys. The first Safer at Home order eased certain restrictions beginning April 30, originally through May 15. Ivey later announced a second amended order that applied statewide from May 11 to May 22. It permitted restaurants to open at a 50% occupancy rate with six feet of spacing between tables. Personal care services like barber shops and salons can operate according to state protocols. Gyms, athletic facilities and athletic classes can resume under strict sanitation and social distancing guidelines. The amended Safer at Home order removes the 10 person limit on non-work gatherings, including those at beaches. People are still required to maintain six feet of distance from non-household members. Under the latest Safer at Home order, all businesses can operate subject to sanitation and social distancing guidelines. Retail stores can operate, at 50 percent occupancy and in line with safety protocols. Beaches are open. Medical procedures are allowed to resume, in accordance with public health and regulatory guidance. Hospitals and nursing homes must continue to restrict visitation.

Educational institutions can open beginning June 1, subject to sanitation and social distancing rules.   Testing and tracing  Anyone who tests positive for the coronavirus must quarantine in their place of residence for 14 days.  Relief and resources  Ivey said local authorities can allow law enforcement officers to issue a summons instead of making an arrest for misdemeanors, with some exceptions, to reduce movement in and out of jails. Local officials were temporarily allowed to reduce the number of local inmates being held in county jails in a way that did not jeopardize public safety. On April 3, Ivey granted temporary relief from residential evictions and foreclosures for the duration of the public health emergency. The proclamation saves people from being thrown out of their homes but doesn't relieve them of the need to pay their rent and mortgage. Ivey announced the launch of altogetheralabama.org, a centralized guide to the state's coronavirus relief efforts. A supplemental emergency proclamation issued April 13 allows the Board of Pardons and Paroles to resume parole hearings in a ""manner that reduces person-to-person interaction."" Alabama was approved to operate Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer, a program that provides supplemental food purchasing benefits to the families of children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Auto insurers are returning more than $100 million in premiums to two million policyholders across the state. Ivey awarded more than $17 million in block grants to 20 community action agencies providing social and emergency services across the state. Ivey issued a proclamation addressing the risks of COVID-19 in state and local correctional facilities and directing the Department of Corrections to revise inmate intake procedures. It requires county jails to maintain custody of state inmates until they can be transferred according to updated procedures, and says the state will reimburse counties for the cost of housing and caring for them in the interim. The state Department of Revenue extended the deadline for obtaining March, April, May and June motor vehicle registrations to July 17. Ivey announced $30 million in CARES Act funding will go towards COVID-19 testing and safety development programs.   Arkansas Status of Stay-at-Home order   Gov.

He also ordered health care workers and first responders eligible for workers' compensation if they are exposed to coronavirus on the job. The state will use Medicaid funds to increase the weekly income of ""long-term services and support direct care workers"" such as nurses, home health aides and hospice service staff. The payments will be made to Medicaid-enrolled agency providers each week through May. The Arkansas Ready for Business Grant Program has $55 million available for businesses across sectors. At least 75% of funding is reserved for businesses with fewer than 50 employees, and at least 15% of recipients will be minority- and women-owned businesses. Hutchinson signed three executive orders on June 15, to remain in effect for the duration of the pandemic. One grants businesses and their employees immunity from civil liability as a result of exposure from COVID-19, except in cases of ""willful, reckless or intentional misconduct"" as defined by the order. Another grants the same immunity to health care workers and providers. The third order assures workers' compensation coverage for employees and designates COVID-19 an occupational disease under the law, stipulating there must be a causal connection between employment and the disease.   Delaware Status of Stay-at-Home order   Gov. John Carney ordered people in his state to stay at home when possible, and nonessential businesses to close, from March 24 through May 15 or ""until the public health threat is eliminated."" He extended the emergency declaration, stay-at-home order and other modifications through May 31.

The protocols limit the number of visitors per household, require check-in upon arrival and the use of face coverings, ban social gatherings and on-site food consumption, designate a one-way route for patrons and prohibit vendors from having products out for others to handle. Carney announced that ice cream shops and trucks can reopen, with restrictions, as of 5:00 p.m. on May 15. The state lifted restrictions on beaches and community pools effective 5:00 p.m. on May 22, though social distancing and hygiene requirements remain in place. Carney released guidance for Phase 1 of the state's rolling reopening plan, which began June 1.

Brown said she will preserve the Corporate Activities Tax, which businesses making more than $1 million must pay regardless of whether they make a profit. The Oregon Republican Party had called for a delay. Oregon received 50,000 masks from Fujian Province, its sister state in China. Oregon Occupational Safety and Health has enacted emergency rules ordering farmers to strengthen requirements in field sanitation, labor housing and transportation to protect agricultural workers. The Oregon Health & Science University is enrolling 100,000 randomly selected Oregonians to voluntarily join its ""Key to Oregon"" research study, to better understand COVID-19 infection patterns. Through the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer program, Oregon will provide cash benefits to the families of the more than 351,000 children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. The state distributed $8.5 million in rent relief to community action agencies, to help tenants who have experienced a loss of income and are at risk of homelessness due to COVID-19. The state is donating 1 million masks and 5,000 gallons of hand sanitizer to farm workers and agricultural producers. Brown said an additional $30 million in food assistance will allow eligible Oregonians to receive the maximum SNAP benefit for June. Brown announced a $30 million investment to secure the state's food supply chain and protect agricultural workers.   Utah Status of Stay-at-Home order   On March 27, Gov. Gary Herbert issued a two-week ""stay safe, stay home directive."" It is not a shelter-in-place order, but instructs Utahns to stay home whenever possible. The directive was extended through April.  Reopening  On April 17, Herbert announced a second version of the Utah Leads Together plan, a three-phase pathway to reactivating the economy. Also as of April 17, Utah's state parks are open to all except those under local health order restrictions. The Utah Department of Health issued an updated public health order on April 21 allowing for the resumption of some elective procedures, in accordance with guidelines developed by the Utah Hospital Association. The state moved from the ""high risk"" phase to the ""moderate phase"" of its recovery timeline on May 1. In this phase, Utahns are urged to stay home and work from home whenever possible. Vulnerable individuals and their household members were told to continue following ""high risk"" protocols. People must still maintain 6 feet of distance from others in public and wear face masks where that is not possible. Out of state travel remains limited, and anyone returning from high-risk areas must self-quarantine for 14 days. Previously closed businesses like gyms, bars and personal care services can reopen if they exercise strict precautions. Dine-in services can resume if restaurants meet specific distancing and hygiene requirements, though takeout and delivery are encouraged. A May 6 executive order clarifies guidelines pertaining to social gatherings, outdoor recreation, personal services, gyms and fitness centers during the moderate and low risk phases. No one should participate in sporting activities that require teammates to be within 10 feet of each other. Clients obtaining personal care services can remove their masks in cases where it would interfere with the service they are receiving. Gyms may allow ""skills and conditioning activities"" when social distancing is practiced. Private social interactions are allowable in groups of 20 or fewer in the moderate-risk phase, and 50 or fewer in the low-risk phase. In the yellow or low-risk phase, most residents are no longer asked to ""leave home infrequently."" While schools remain closed, opportunities for driver's education will reopen. The gathering limit for private social interactions grows from 20 to 50 people. Youth and club team sports are permitted, with symptom checking and socially distanced spectators. Certain guidelines at swimming pools will be relaxed. On May 20, Herbert announced the third version of the ""Utah Leads Together Plan,"" which shares instructions for high-risk populations, addresses impacts on the state's multicultural community and outlines plans for economic recovery. Much of the state moved into the ""low risk"" phase on May 16, with the exception of several cities and counties. Vulnerable populations must continue following high risk protocols, regardless of their community's designation. Herbert moved two additional counties into the low-risk, or yellow, phase on May 21. Herbert issued an order moving two municipalities from low to moderate risk status on May 22. Herbert issued an executive order updating guidelines pertaining to travel, educational institutions, social gatherings, entertainment, businesses and events in areas designated low risk, effective May 27. Herbert moved additional areas to low risk status on May 29. Herbert moved one county to the green or ""new normal"" phase on June 12. Most of the state remains in the yellow phase, in which he said there are ""no economic activities that are categorically prohibited if common-sense precautions are in place."" Herbert released updated guidance for businesses and the general public in areas designated ""low"" and ""new normal."" The new guidance pertains specifically to high-risk individuals, gatherings, business, education and events.  Herbert announced the release of Utah Leads Together Volume 4, which lays the foundation for economic recovery and focuses specifically on the next 100, 250 and 500 days. The framework emphasizes connecting unemployed individuals with available jobs, distributing CARES Act and other assistance, reskilling and upskilling workers and investing in construction-ready infrastructure projects that will facilitate economic growth. Herbert approved nine rural counties to enter the green or ""new normal"" phase, effective June 19. An executive order requires people to wear masks at all state facilities ""under the purview"" of the governor's office, including state higher education facilities. Herbert said on June 24 that due to an increase in cases, the state will not be considering applications for relaxing restrictions for two weeks. The Utah State Board of Education released K-12 school reopening guidance, requiring public schools to create and post plans by August 1.  Closed, canceled and delayed  Public and charter schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year.  Testing and tracing  Herbert introduced the Healthy Together app, which enables Utahns to track their symptoms and connect with COVID-19 testing while helping health officials perform contact tracing.  Relief and resources  Herbert ordered a moratorium on residential evictions for certain tenants who have been directly impacted by COVID-19. Herbert has instructed residents to wear homemade masks in public places. Herbert announced the creation of the Utah Multicultural Task Force Subcommittee, a group within the larger coronavirus task force that will address barriers facing minority communities. Herbert announced ""A Mask For Every Utahn,"" a public-private partnership that will provide a free face mask to residents who do not yet have one. Herbert issued an executive order temporarily suspending enforcement on expired vehicle registrations through May 15. On May 5, Herbert announced the launch of the ""PPE Push Pack"" program to support small businesses in their transition to ""moderate risk"" COVID-19 protocols. The public-private partnership provides a free one-week supply of personal protective equipment to sole proprietors and businesses with fewer than 50 employees. Herbert suspended certain requirements for retail licensees serving alcoholic beverages, to ensure that pandemic-related closures mandated by public health do not cause licensing issues. Farmers Feeding Utah delivered 18,000 pounds of lamb meat and 10,000 pounds of flour to assist the Navajo Nation.   Washington Status of Stay-at-Home order    On March 23, Gov. Jay Inslee issued an order requiring ""every Washingtonian to stay home unless they need to pursue an essential activity."" The ""Stay Home, Stay Healthy"" order also closed all nonessential businesses and banned all gatherings for ""social, spiritual and recreational purposes."" It expired at the end of May. High-risk populations must follow the ""Stay Home, Stay Healthy"" directives for three of the plan's four phases. Inslee announced a statewide mandate requiring all individuals to wear face coverings in indoor and outdoor public spaces, effective June 26.  Reopening  The governors of California, Oregon and Washington announced the Western States Pact on April 13. The framework offers principles and goals for a shared approach to reopening states' economies. Colorado and Nevada joined the pact on April 27. On April 21, Inslee announced ""Washington's Recovery Plan,"" a framework for the loosening of restrictions and gradual return to public life, contingent on slowing the spread of COVID-19. Inslee said on April 24 that ""low-risk"" construction projects already underway can resume if they comply with physical distancing and other requirements. Inslee announced the partial reopening of certain outdoor recreation activities beginning May 5. Fishing, hunting and golfing will be permitted with appropriate safety precautions, as is day use of state parks, state public lands managed by the Department of Natural Resources and state Fish and Wildlife areas. Many state parks reopened on May 5 for day-use recreation, while several remain closed ""until further notice.""  Inslee issued guidance for drive-in religious services, as well as vehicle and vessel sales. Low-risk higher education and critical workforce training work is allowed to resume as of May 5. Inslee released guidance for restarting essential workforce development programs. Car wash operations can resume after meeting specific criteria, effective May 7. Inslee issued industry requirements and guidance. Inslee signed an executive order on May 4 implementing the state's ""Safe Start"" recovery plan. The plan allows smaller counties to apply for a variance from the order, enabling them to loosen some restrictions sooner. Washington entered the first phase of gradual reopening on May 5. Under Phase 1 of the reopening plan, only essential travel and some outdoor recreation is allowed. Social gatherings are not permitted, and only drive-in spiritual services can be held, with one household per vehicle. Essential businesses, existing construction projects, landscaping, car washes, pet walkers and automobile sales can operate. Retail stores can offer curbside pickup only. Inslee announced new criteria for additional counties to apply for variances to move to Phase 2. Inslee issued guidance for partially reopening the dine-in restaurant and tavern industry in counties granted variance to enter Phase 2, effective May 11. For counties in Phase 2, limited in-store retail and additional manufacturing operations can resume effective May 12, in line with industry-specific guidance. For counties in Phase 2, personal care and professional services can resume as of May 13, in line with state guidance. For counties in Phase 2, additional outdoor recreation activities may resume as of May 14 in line with guidance. Permitted activities include guided ATV, paddle sports and horseback riding, tennis, guided fishing, go-carting, ORV/motocross and participant-only motorsports. Inslee issued guidance for construction, golf and professional photography services in Phase 2. All construction, including new work, is allowed, and additional golf activities can resume for counties in that phase. Pet grooming operations can also resume. The state is asking patrons at businesses to voluntarily provide contact information for one person per household, in case of COVID-19 exposure. Inslee said the information will be shared only with public health officials. As of May 18, elective health services can resume at providers statewide for medical and dental providers that meet certain criteria. In-person real estate operations with up to three people, as well as fitness and training operations, may resume beginning May 19 for counties in Phase 2. Fitness activities must be limited to groups of five or fewer trainees and one instructor. On June 1, Washington's stay-at-home order was officially replaced by Safe Start, a phased county-by-county reopening plan. Any county can apply to the Department of Health to move to the subsequent phase if they meet certain criteria. As of June 19, there are three counties in Phase 1, two counties in Phase 1.5, 20 counties in Phase 2 and 14 counties in Phase 3. Inslee issued guidance for in-person workforce training programs in Phases 1 and 2. Inslee issued guidance for library operations in Phases 1 and 2, and drive-in theater operations for Phase 2. Inslee issued guidance for professional sporting activities, youth team sports and adult recreational team sports in Phases 2 and 3. He later released additional guidance documents expanding options for counties in Phase 1.5 and updating protocols for certain recreational activities. Inslee released a template to help businesses in Phase 3 develop a written COVID-19 safety plan, as required by the state's reopening plan. Effective June 8, all employers must provide cloth face coverings to employees, who are required to wear them with some exceptions. Inslee released guidance for domestic services in Phase 2. Inslee issued a proclamation outlining the state's plan to ""possibly"" reopen schools in the fall. The state's Superintendent of Public Instruction said he expects schools to reopen for in-person learning this fall, and released planning guidance for the start of the 2020-2021 academic year. Inslee issued guidance for the reopening of card rooms and related businesses in Phase 2. Updated guidance for religious and faith-based services expand indoor capacity limits while continuing requirements for face coverings and social distancing. In Phase 3, services are limited to 50% capacity or 400 people, whichever is smaller. In modified Phase 1 and Phase 2 counties, services can be held at 25% capacity or 200 people. In Phase 1 counties, services can be held outdoors only, with no more than 100 attendees. Inslee issued additional guidelines for non-religious weddings and funeral services in Phases 1, 2 and 3. Officials released guidance for restarting in-person instruction at higher education institutions in the fall. Each institution develop and implement their own reopening plan while meeting state requirements. Inslee announced on June 27 that health officials are putting a pause on counties moving to Phase 4. Inslee extended the Safe Start proclamation until July 9.  Closed, canceled and delayed  Inslee issued a directive to state agencies to freeze all hiring, personal service contracts and equipment purchases, effective May 18. He called for higher education institutions and other boards and commissions to follow suit. Inslee announced the cancellation of scheduled wage increases for nearly 5,600 state employees, and the implementation of a furlough plan impacting some 40,000 state employees through November.  Testing and tracing  Inslee announced the launch of a statewide contact tracing initiative, with a team of over 1300 tracers set to be trained and ready by May 15. After the state Department of Health ordered widespread testing at long-term care facilities, Inslee announced a plan to test all nursing home residents and staff by June 12, and all residents and staff at assisted living facilities with a memory care unit by June 26. Inslee is encouraging people even with mild symptoms to get tested. Household members and close contacts of a confirmed case, as well as anyone living or working in a congregate setting who was likely exposed to an outbreak, should also get tested. State Department of Health guidance says tests should be available at no cost, regardless of whether a patient has insurance.  Relief and resources  The state has created a grant fund for small businesses, using a portion of the state's Strategic Reserve Fund. Inslee, in partnership with nonprofits and local philanthropies, announced the launch of the WA Food Fund on April 7. The relief fund will work to meet increasingly high demand at food banks across the state. Inslee announced on April 13 that the Department of Corrections would implement strategies for reducing the state's prison population, starting by focusing on the early release of vulnerable individuals through commutation and modified reentry programs. Two days later, he issued proclamation and commutation orders releasing certain eligible inmates ahead of their original release dates on or before June 29. Inslee issued a proclamation extending certain rights and safeguards to high-risk workers so that they can protect themselves against COVID-19 without jeopardizing their employment status. He has since extended the proclamation through August 1. Three proclamations issued April 14 suspend certain criminal statutes of limitations, streamline the renewal of commercial driver licenses and learner permits, and protect consumer assets from debt collection. Inslee expanded protections for renters in an April 16 proclamation, extending his initial moratorium on evictions and adding new provisions. The moratorium now covers hotels, motels, Airbnb rentals, public campgrounds and other transitional housing. Landlords are prohibited from raising rents, charging late fees and making threats. Inslee has extended the eviction moratorium through August 1. An expanded proclamation temporarily prohibits energy, water and landline phone providers from disconnecting residential customers due to nonpayment, refusing to connect those who were previously disconnected due to nonpayment, and charging late fees. It does not relieve customers from their obligation to pay utility bills. A multi-state initiative will expand payment relief for people with private and non-federal student loans, which are not covered by the CARES Act. The agreement expands protections to student loan borrowers in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. Nearly $300 million of the state's federal stimulus funding will be distributed to local governments that did not receive direct contributions under the CARES Act. On April 29, Inslee released a COVID-19 risk assessment dashboard to inform decisions about lifting restrictions. The five-dial dashboard will be updated weekly on Wednesdays. The state has opened more than 300 new drive-in WiFi hot spots to provide free temporary internet access to all residents, particularly students, without broadband service in their homes. Washington was approved to operate Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer, a program that provides assistance to the families of children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Inslee issued a proclamation with additional health and safety guidelines pertaining to worker housing, transportation and job site requirements for the agricultural industry. He later issued guidance clarifying these requirements.   Wyoming Status of Stay-at-Home order   Wyoming did not enact a statewide stay-at-home order, though Gov. Mark Gordon issued a plea on March 25 for ""citizens to stay home whenever possible, only going out when absolutely necessary."" Certain businesses and services can reopen beginning May 1.  Reopening  On April 3, Gordon extended existing statewide health orders through April 30 and issued a directive requiring any person entering Wyoming from outside of the state to self-quarantine for 14 days. Beginning May 8, out-of-state travelers are no longer required to self-quarantine, though they are urged to be careful. On April 23, Gordon announced a plan for gradually lifting restrictions. The phased approach to reopening will rely on six health metrics and give counties the flexibility to request variances based on local conditions. Public health orders effective May 1 allow gyms, barber shops, hair salons and other personal care services to reopen under certain conditions. Child care and home day care centers may also operate with specific precautions. Businesses that choose to remain closed will still be eligible for Small Business Administration assistance. The Department of Health issued guidance to hospitals and health care providers for resuming elective surgeries. Counties are allowed to waive certain state public health regulations based on local health data. As of May 8, most counties have been granted variances for dining and/or gathering restrictions. Gordon expressed support for the phased reopening of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. Both parks began gradually lifting restrictions on May 18. A modified public health order effective May 15 eases restrictions on certain businesses and increases the maximum gathering size to 25 people. Restaurants can offer indoor and outdoor dining service under specific conditions. Movie theaters and performance venues can reopen in a limited capacity. Gyms can reopen locker rooms, offer personal training and provide group classes for up to 20 participants. Child care facilities can allow up to 25 people in a classroom. Roads, hiking trails and rock climbing routes at Devil's Tower National Monument reopened to public access on May 22, with limited services. Effective June 1, outdoor gatherings of up to 250 people are permitted, provided there are social distancing and sanitation measures in place. Effective June 15, indoor gatherings of up to 250 people are allowed, and parades can take place with social distancing. K-12 schools, community colleges, the University of Wyoming and other educational institutions can resume in-person instruction for all students in groups of no more than 50 people. Updated public health orders effective June 15 allow child care facilities to resume normal operations with unlimited class sizes, expand group fitness class limits to 50 people and no longer require personal care services to operate by appointment only. Long-term care facilities are allowed to resume outdoor, in-person visitation under specific health guidelines. Gordon announced on June 29 that Wyoming's existing public health orders will remain unchanged through July 15, due to an increase in cases.  Closed, canceled and delayed  Wyoming Democrats conducted their presidential preference caucus entirely by mail. Gordon directed state agencies to institute position freezes, halt general fund contracts larger than $100,000 and implement a ""rigorous review of major maintenance spending"" to prepare for COVID-19 budget impacts. He has since instructed them to further reduce spending and prepare for additional cuts. Six of the state's largest rodeos, originally scheduled for late June and July, have been canceled.   Testing and tracing  Gordon said the state will test a percentage of residents and staff at each long-term care facility, and conduct weekly testing at facilities that have a confirmed case.  Relief and resources  The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office donated 50,000 medical face masks to the state. Gordon allocated $17 million in federal funding to expand the state's testing contact tracing capabilities and grow its supply of personal protective equipment. The Wyoming Emergency Housing Assistance Program will provide rent and mortgage payment assistance to eligible residents who are experiencing pandemic-related financial hardship. The state legislature established three grant programs to distribute $325 million in CARES Act funding for small business owners financially impacted by the pandemic. Applications for the first of those programs, which will provide grants of up to $50,000 to businesses with no more than 50 employees, opened on June 8.

You fall in love with a plant at the store. You bring it home. You find a cute spot for it on your bookshelf. Then, after a few weeks, that lush, beautiful plant you picked out is ... suddenly on its last leaf. Many of us — in our eagerness to bring nature into our homes  — have lost a houseplant or two along the way. Maybe that pothos in the background of your Zoom call isn't looking so hot anymore, or you're ready to try again after killing that succulent. Wherever you are in your plant parenthood journey, NPR's Life Kit is here to help. And while we can't cover the specific needs of every individual plant, we can get you started with a strong foundation. Here are six tips to help your plant live its best life: 1. Find your light. Enlarge this image                You can figure out the intensity of your light — low, medium or bright — by holding your hand (or the leaf of a Swiss cheese plant) about a foot over where you'll place the plant to see what sort of shadow it casts.                                                                        Photo Illustration by Becky Harlan/NPR                                    hide captiontoggle caption                Photo Illustration by Becky Harlan/NPR            You can figure out the intensity of your light — low, medium or bright — by holding your hand (or the leaf of a Swiss cheese plant) about a foot over where you'll place the plant to see what sort of shadow it casts.                        Photo Illustration by Becky Harlan/NPR                    The first thing you need to do is figure out the type of lighting you have. Intensity  Different light intensities are described as low, medium and bright. This can depend on a bunch of different factors, including the time of year and the direction your windows face. (In the US, south-facing windows will have the strongest light, while north-facing windows will get the weakest.)  If you're wondering what you have in your home, here's a quick test: Hold your hand about a foot above where you want to put your plant. If it casts a shadow with crisp, clear lines, you're working with bright light. If the silhouette of your hand looks a little fuzzy, that's medium light. Low light is essentially just enough light for you to read a book.  Life Kit This Is A Good Time To Start A Garden. Here's HowDirect vs. indirect light If there's a straight line from the sun to your plant, that's direct light. Indirect light is diffused by something such as clouds, curtains or trees outside your window. Plants such as succulents and cactuses will appreciate some direct light, but be careful about burning the leaves on more tropical types. Overall, most houseplants are going to do well in medium or bright indirect light. If you're working with lower light, pothos, snake plants, some philodendrons and ZZ plants will tolerate low light. Low light is not no light  An important clarification here: Low light is not the same thing as no light. If you have zero natural sunlight coming in, you'll need to consider getting grow lights. If your plant is starting to look ""leggy"" or stretched out, that's a sign it isn't getting enough light. It might also start putting out smaller leaves or stop growing altogether. 2. Remember your roots. Enlarge this image                If your plant is rootbound — where the roots have wrapped around the inside of the pot and are outgrowing it — it might be time to upgrade to a bigger pot.                                                                        Photo Illustration by Becky Harlan/NPR                                    hide captiontoggle caption                Photo Illustration by Becky Harlan/NPR            If your plant is rootbound — where the roots have wrapped around the inside of the pot and are outgrowing it — it might be time to upgrade to a bigger pot.                        Photo Illustration by Becky Harlan/NPR                    You'll also need to choose the proper pot and soil mix for your specific plant.  It starts with soil ""Plants need a balance of water, air and nutrients in order to do their best,"" says Kirsten Conrad, an agriculture natural resource agent with the Virginia Cooperative Extension. ""A good soil mix is going to have pores that maintain good spaces for air to get into."" Most ready-made soil mixes at the store are just fine. Plants need pockets of oxygen in the soil to survive, so proper drainage is critical. This is why potting mixes will often include bigger chunks, such as perlite or orchid bark, to help extra water pass through more quickly. Root rot  When soil doesn't have proper drainage — and when you overwater — you risk your plant contracting root rot. This is when those tiny air pockets in your soil become waterlogged for too long. Your plant will essentially drown, and fungus takes hold in the roots. Check for this by gently lifting your plant out of its pot and taking a look at its roots. It's easiest to do this when the soil is dry. ""Normal, healthy roots are white to cream-colored,"" Conrad says. ""A plant that is ... experiencing root rot is going to have roots that are dark-colored. They're gonna be chocolate brown or almost sometimes black. The coating of the roots will sometimes slip off as you touch them."" Picking a pot  The right pot can also help with drainage. When you bring a new plant home, give it at least a month to settle in before you repot it. When it is time for a new container, make sure it has a drainage hole in the bottom. From there, there are a few other factors to consider. Clay and terra-cotta pots are porous, so they'll help wick extra moisture out of the soil. That makes them great for things such as snake plants and hoyas, which like to dry out a little between waterings. Pots that are glazed or made of plastic will keep the soil moist, for things such as ferns and prayer plants. The big move  Over time, you might notice roots growing out of that drainage hole. That's your cue to check and see if your plant is rootbound — where the roots have wrapped around the inside of the pot and are outgrowing it. ""You have kids — their feet grow every few weeks. You're not going to keep them in the same shoes, right?"" says Hilton Carter, an author, plant stylist and parent of about 200 plants. ""You're going to make sure they get bigger shoes so their feet can expand, so they can grow taller and bigger. That's the same thing for your plant."" When you are upsizing your pot, a good rule of thumb is to increase the diameter by 2 inches each time. 3. Ditch that strict watering schedule.  Source: Photo Illustration by Becky Harlan/NPROverwatering is one of the most common ways people kill their houseplants. So, how do you know when to give it a drink? The finger test  One of the simplest ways is the finger test. Stick your index finger (or a wooden chopstick) a couple inches into the soil and feel if it's still moist. Different houseplants have different needs, but a general guideline is to water when the top 2 inches of soil are dry. You could also buy a moisture meter online or at a local garden center. ""Your soil might dry out faster this week than it does the next week,"" Carter says. ""Never, just never stick to: 'Every Sunday I water my plants.' It should be whenever the soil itself is ready to be watered."" When you do water your plants, make sure you do so thoroughly — you should see water trickle out of the drainage hole.  Life Kit How To Compost At Home Too much water? Not enough?  Sometimes, it can be tricky to tell whether a plant is looking sad because it's been underwatered, or because it's gotten too much water and developed root rot. If your plant is underwatered, it will probably try to tell you. A peace lily will droop if it dries out. A pothos might curl its leaves in or start to crisp up.  Some telltale signs that a plant has been overwatered are when you see yellowing leaves, the soil is staying consistently wet or you find root rot. If you've gone overboard on the water, put that watering can down. Let the soil dry out. If your plant has root rot, use sterilized scissors to carefully trim off the rotted portions. Also be sure to clean out the pot and give your plant fresh soil. 4. Give your plant a name.

""And then you'll be able to ... correct that situation right then and there. And you won't show up like a month or two later and then all of a sudden have an infestation."" There are a few common pests to watch out for. Spider mites are these tiny arachnids that leave thin webbing on the undersides of leaves. Mealybugs are white, cottony-looking insects. You may also run into scale, thrips or aphids — all of which feed on your plant and can do serious damage if left unchecked. One way to help, particularly with spider mites, is to make sure your plants have enough humidity. You can use a humidifier or keep your plant on a tray filled with pebbles and water. If you do notice pests, isolate that plant from any others. Rinse it off in the shower or with a hose outside. You can then treat the plant by spraying it with a diluted mix of water and either an insecticidal dish soap or neem oil. ""You just want a very basic dish soap,"" says Adam Pyle, a horticulturist at the U.S. Botanic Garden. ""You don't want to use one that says antibacterial. You don't want to use one that says ultra-concentrated. ""Sometimes it might take two or three [treatments], but you'll want to give yourself a week to two weeks in between applications to see if it's taken effect.""

You fall in love with a plant at the store. You bring it home. You find a cute spot for it on your bookshelf. Then, after a few weeks, that lush, beautiful plant you picked out is ... suddenly on its last leaf. Many of us — in our eagerness to bring nature into our homes  — have lost a houseplant or two along the way. Maybe that pothos in the background of your Zoom call isn't looking so hot anymore, or you're ready to try again after killing that succulent. Wherever you are in your plant parenthood journey, NPR's Life Kit is here to help. And while we can't cover the specific needs of every individual plant, we can get you started with a strong foundation. Here are six tips to help your plant live its best life: 1. Find your light. Enlarge this image                You can figure out the intensity of your light — low, medium or bright — by holding your hand (or the leaf of a Swiss cheese plant) about a foot over where you'll place the plant to see what sort of shadow it casts.

Photo Illustration by Becky Harlan/NPR                    The first thing you need to do is figure out the type of lighting you have. Intensity  Different light intensities are described as low, medium and bright. This can depend on a bunch of different factors, including the time of year and the direction your windows face. (In the US, south-facing windows will have the strongest light, while north-facing windows will get the weakest.)  If you're wondering what you have in your home, here's a quick test: Hold your hand about a foot above where you want to put your plant. If it casts a shadow with crisp, clear lines, you're working with bright light. If the silhouette of your hand looks a little fuzzy, that's medium light. Low light is essentially just enough light for you to read a book.  Life Kit This Is A Good Time To Start A Garden. Here's HowDirect vs. indirect light If there's a straight line from the sun to your plant, that's direct light. Indirect light is diffused by something such as clouds, curtains or trees outside your window. Plants such as succulents and cactuses will appreciate some direct light, but be careful about burning the leaves on more tropical types. Overall, most houseplants are going to do well in medium or bright indirect light. If you're working with lower light, pothos, snake plants, some philodendrons and ZZ plants will tolerate low light. Low light is not no light  An important clarification here: Low light is not the same thing as no light. If you have zero natural sunlight coming in, you'll need to consider getting grow lights. If your plant is starting to look ""leggy"" or stretched out, that's a sign it isn't getting enough light. It might also start putting out smaller leaves or stop growing altogether. 2. Remember your roots. Enlarge this image                If your plant is rootbound — where the roots have wrapped around the inside of the pot and are outgrowing it — it might be time to upgrade to a bigger pot.

Photo Illustration by Becky Harlan/NPR                    You'll also need to choose the proper pot and soil mix for your specific plant.  It starts with soil ""Plants need a balance of water, air and nutrients in order to do their best,"" says Kirsten Conrad, an agriculture natural resource agent with the Virginia Cooperative Extension. ""A good soil mix is going to have pores that maintain good spaces for air to get into."" Most ready-made soil mixes at the store are just fine. Plants need pockets of oxygen in the soil to survive, so proper drainage is critical. This is why potting mixes will often include bigger chunks, such as perlite or orchid bark, to help extra water pass through more quickly. Root rot  When soil doesn't have proper drainage — and when you overwater — you risk your plant contracting root rot. This is when those tiny air pockets in your soil become waterlogged for too long. Your plant will essentially drown, and fungus takes hold in the roots. Check for this by gently lifting your plant out of its pot and taking a look at its roots. It's easiest to do this when the soil is dry. ""Normal, healthy roots are white to cream-colored,"" Conrad says. ""A plant that is ... experiencing root rot is going to have roots that are dark-colored. They're gonna be chocolate brown or almost sometimes black. The coating of the roots will sometimes slip off as you touch them."" Picking a pot  The right pot can also help with drainage.

The finger test  One of the simplest ways is the finger test. Stick your index finger (or a wooden chopstick) a couple inches into the soil and feel if it's still moist. Different houseplants have different needs, but a general guideline is to water when the top 2 inches of soil are dry. You could also buy a moisture meter online or at a local garden center. ""Your soil might dry out faster this week than it does the next week,"" Carter says. ""Never, just never stick to: 'Every Sunday I water my plants.' It should be whenever the soil itself is ready to be watered."" When you do water your plants, make sure you do so thoroughly — you should see water trickle out of the drainage hole.  Life Kit How To Compost At Home Too much water? Not enough?  Sometimes, it can be tricky to tell whether a plant is looking sad because it's been underwatered, or because it's gotten too much water and developed root rot. If your plant is underwatered, it will probably try to tell you. A peace lily will droop if it dries out. A pothos might curl its leaves in or start to crisp up.  Some telltale signs that a plant has been overwatered are when you see yellowing leaves, the soil is staying consistently wet or you find root rot. If you've gone overboard on the water, put that watering can down. Let the soil dry out. If your plant has root rot, use sterilized scissors to carefully trim off the rotted portions. Also be sure to clean out the pot and give your plant fresh soil. 4. Give your plant a name.

Photo Illustration by Becky Harlan/NPR                    We've talked a lot about the work involved with a plant. But, of course, keeping houseplants is fun, too. To help stay invested in caring for your plant, consider giving it a name. It doesn't have to be super original: Phil the Philodendron. An Alocasia polly named Polly. The point is to feel attached to your plant.  Life Kit How To Reduce Food Waste""When you name your plant, it pushes you to be a better plant parent,"" Carter says. ""It's really hard to toss out a plant when it's suffering when it has a name."" You may also notice all that time with your plants — watering, trimming, dusting off their leaves — can feel pretty nice for you, too. ""That's when I get all of the moments for me to meditate. That's where ... that self-care comes into play,"" Carter says. ""Seeing new life, seeing new growth. All that positive reinforcement is coming to me at that point because I can see my hard work paying off."" 5. Be a proactive plant parent.

You know that saying: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure? Pests ""In that process of that routine maintenance, you'll notice if you have a bug or two,"" Carter says. ""And then you'll be able to ... correct that situation right then and there. And you won't show up like a month or two later and then all of a sudden have an infestation."" There are a few common pests to watch out for. Spider mites are these tiny arachnids that leave thin webbing on the undersides of leaves. Mealybugs are white, cottony-looking insects. You may also run into scale, thrips or aphids — all of which feed on your plant and can do serious damage if left unchecked. One way to help, particularly with spider mites, is to make sure your plants have enough humidity. You can use a humidifier or keep your plant on a tray filled with pebbles and water. If you do notice pests, isolate that plant from any others. Rinse it off in the shower or with a hose outside. You can then treat the plant by spraying it with a diluted mix of water and either an insecticidal dish soap or neem oil. ""You just want a very basic dish soap,"" says Adam Pyle, a horticulturist at the U.S. Botanic Garden. ""You don't want to use one that says antibacterial. You don't want to use one that says ultra-concentrated. ""Sometimes it might take two or three [treatments], but you'll want to give yourself a week to two weeks in between applications to see if it's taken effect."" If you don't know what's plaguing your plant, you can reach out to the U.S. Botanic Garden's plant hotline either online (send photos!) or over the phone at 202-226-4785.  6.

Taking care of plants isn't some innate talent. It's a skill you learn.

What's important is that you learn from them, do your homework and take the time. ""So if you consider yourself having a brown thumb, you can easily have a green thumb tomorrow,"" Carter says.

Nati Harnik/AP                    Part of a series on coronavirus-related restrictions across the United States. Jump to a state: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin, other states  Illinois  Status of Stay-at-Home order     Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued a stay-at-home or in-place-of-residence order that allows for residents to leave for essential activities, essential government functions or to operate essential businesses or operations. A modified version of the order was in effect from May 1 through the end of the month. All four regions have met the required benchmarks to begin Phase 3 of reopening, and most of the state did so on May 29. Beginning May 1, individuals must wear masks or face coverings in public places where they cannot maintain 6 feet of distance from others.  Reopening  On May 5, Pritzker announced ""Restore Illinois,"" a five-phase plan for reopening the state on a regional basis. The state entered Phase 2 with its modified stay-at-home order on May 1. Regions that meet certain thresholds will be able to move from the ""flattening"" to the ""recovery"" phase after several weeks. Health care facilities may resume certain elective surgeries for non-life-threatening conditions beginning May 1, in accordance with public health guidance. Pritzker announced the additional businesses and activities permitted to reopen in Phase 3.

Previously closed providers can open with limitations when their region enters Phase 3, and can expand to larger capacity after four weeks. There will be no restrictions on which families can use child care. The state issued industry-specific guidelines for businesses reopening in Phase 3, including retail, offices, manufacturing, barbershops and salons, summer programs, outdoor recreation activities and outdoor dining at bars and restaurants. Pritzker signed a bill allowing bars and restaurants with liquor licenses to sell cocktails for pickup and delivery. Pritzker signed an executive order allowing public and private schools to reopen for limited in-person summer school, in line with Phase 3 guidelines. He later released guidelines to help K-12 schools, community colleges and higher education institutions resume in-person instruction for the upcoming academic year. The state began Phase 4 on June 26. In Phase 4, gathering limits expand from 10 to 50 people, and additional sectors such as health, fitness, movies, theaters, museums, zoos and indoor restaurant dining can open or expand with capacity restrictions. Revised guidelines permit additional activities in youth and recreational sports, health and fitness centers and day camps.   Closed, canceled and delayed  Pritzker signed an executive order canceling the Illinois and Du Quoin State Fairs in 2020. The Department of Agriculture will hold a Junior Livestock Expo in September, and the 4-H General Project Show will take place virtually.  Testing and tracing  Pritzker announced on April 29 that the state had distributed nearly 20 million items of personal protective equipment to public health departments, hospitals, nursing homes and nonprofit organizations in every county. COVID-19 testing is available to any individuals with symptoms, as well as asymptomatic health care workers, first responders, critical infrastructure employees, individuals exposed to confirmed cases and individuals with compromised immune systems or chronic medical conditions. The Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs announced on May 13 that all residents and staff at the state's four veteran's homes had been tested for COVID-19. Pritzker announced the Illinois Contact Tracing Collaborative, a technology-based approach to scaling up existing local contact tracing systems. The state Department of Public Health will drive the curriculum and software, and can support funding for local health department hires where needed. Two local health departments are piloting the initiative. The Illinois Department of Public Health filed emergency rules requiring long-term care facilities to comply with infection control practices, including developing and implementing a plan to test all residents and staff. The state is expanding its community-based testing sites to offer tests to everyone, regardless of symptoms. Tests are at no cost to the individual, and no appointment, doctor's referral or insurance is needed.  Relief and resources  On March 27, Pritzker announced measures to expand SNAP benefits and increase support for child care providers and people experiencing homelessness. All essential workers in health care, human services, government services, and infrastructure qualify for the state's Child Care Assistance Program as of April 1. Under an executive order issued April 6, the Illinois Department of Corrections director can allow ""medically vulnerable"" inmates to temporarily leave prison for the duration of the state's disaster proclamation. Illinois' tax filing deadline has been extended to July 15. The state awarded $14 million to over 700 bars, restaurants and hotels through the Hospitality Emergency Grant Program.

A multi-state initiative will expand payment relief for people with private and non-federal student loans, which are not covered by the CARES Act. The agreement expands protections to student loan borrowers in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. A May 1 executive order temporarily allows county governments to issue marriage licenses via audio-video communication technology. The state is putting $25 million of existing funding towards Fast-Track Public Infrastructure Grants, a new initiative to accelerate work on local, planned infrastructure projects that are ready to begin work this summer. The state launched the Get Hired Illinois job portal, and will offer residents free unlimited access to online workforce development courses through a partnership with Coursera, beginning in June. Registration for the workforce recovery initiative is open through September, and courses must be completed by December 31. The ""Illinois Connected Communities"" grant program will assist local governments, schools and communities with building broadband capacity.  As of June 2, 1.8 million SNAP recipients are automatically able to purchase food online from participating grocery retailers. Illinois received an additional $1.3 million in Family Violence Protection Act funds through the CARES Act, which will be used to provide additional services for domestic violence survivors and their families. The Downstate Small Business Stabilization Program distributed its first round of grants totaling $1.3 million to 65 businesses in 28 communities.

Pritzker signed legislation promoting safe participation in the general election by providing vote by mail applications to all recent Illinois voters, expanding early voting hours at permanent polling places, improving the signature verification process and making election day a state holiday. Pritzker announced a $900 million package of grant programs to help families and businesses impacted by the pandemic and civil unrest.  The Illinois Commerce Commission approved an agreement offering more flexible credit and collection procedures to eligible residential and small business utility customers, starting after the moratorium on disconnections for non-payments and late payments expires.  Pritzker signed legislation expanding the emergency use of remote learning and modifying the School Code in response to COVID-19. The state will provide public K-12 schools with a total of 2.5 million cloth masks to help them meet reopening requirements.    Shots - Health News Tracking The Pandemic: How Quickly Is The Coronavirus Spreading State By State? Indiana Status of Stay-at-Home order     Gov. Eric Holcomb ordered Indiana residents to remain in their homes except for work deemed essential, caring for others and obtaining necessary supplies, beginning March 25. A two-week stay-at-home order issued April 6 extended earlier restrictions such as those limiting on-site restaurant, bar, and nightclub operations. It also closed campgrounds and required essential businesses to follow specific social distancing measures. On April 20, Holcomb issued a revised order effective through May 1.

It also allows hospitals to conduct ""medically necessary procedures."" Beginning April 27, health care providers can resume elective procedures if they have a sufficient supply of personal protective equipment and implement certain recommendations. Laundry service providers and daycare facilities remained open as essential businesses. On May 1, Holcomb announced a five-phased ""Back on Track"" plan to gradually lift restrictions in most of the state. Local governments can impose more restrictive guidelines.

Outdoor visitation at assisted living facilities and nursing homes is permitted, and hospital visits are encouraged with precautions. Casinos can open with the approval of the Indiana Gaming Commission as of June 15. All Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles branches resumed walk-in service on June 15, with all transactions available except for driving skills exams. Holcomb announced on July that 1 most restrictions will remain in place through July 17, with some lifting on July 4 in a modified version 4.5 of the state's reopening plan.

Testing and tracing  Holcomb announced on April 28 that the state will launch 50 new testing sites in two weeks, partnering with OptumServe Health Services to expand testing capacity. Once the sites are open, an additional 6,600 Hoosiers can be tested per day. Testing is free and by appointment only, and insurance is not required. Individuals must have symptoms, be at high risk or have been exposed to a confirmed case in order to be eligible. The state is also partnering with the company Maximus to centralize contact tracing efforts. Holcomb announced plans to hire and train 500 employees for a call center that is expected to be operational around May 11. As of June 15, free tests are open to any Hoosier who wants to get tested, regardless of symptoms.  Relief and resources  Holcomb signed an executive order on April 7 allowing retired and inactive EMS professionals to provide health care services if they work under a licensed supervisor or obtain a temporary certification from the state's Department of Homeland Security. Holcomb issued an executive order allowing pharmacy students who have successfully completed all required course work to apply for temporary licenses with the Professional Licensing Agency. The Indiana Department of Revenue delayed certain tax filing deadlines to July 15, in line with the federal extension. A May 8 executive order extends specific individual and business tax deadlines to match federal law. The Indiana Office of Community and Rural Affairs is awarding more than $1.96 million in federal grant funding to 13 rural communities through the new COVID-19 Response Program. Holcomb signed an executive order to expedite the review of unemployment insurance claim appeals and extend the business personal property tax deadlines to June 15. The state launched BeWellIndiana.com, a free website with mental health resources for coronavirus-induced stress as well as pre-existing concerns. An executive order extended Bureau of Motor Vehicles renewal deadlines, making driver's licenses, identification cards and vehicle registrations that expire prior to June 4 valid through that date. It also postponed deadlines for expiring state-issued professional licenses and permits, which have since been extended to June 30. The order also ensures election workers are able to collect stipends without reducing their unemployment benefits. Holcomb announced the allocation of nearly $44 million to economic recovery initiatives, largely in the form of direct funding to small businesses and manufacturers. Eligible businesses can apply for the Small Business Restart Grant to cover pandemic-related expenses. An executive order allows older youth to remain in foster care beyond the age of 18 during the public health emergency, continuing their access to education, workforce training and health benefits. Holcomb announced the launch of ""Rapid Recovery for a Better Future,"" a $50 million initiative to help individuals and businesses get back to work and access career and skill development resources. Small businesses with 150 employees or less that are otherwise unable to secure personal protective equipment can request it through the state's online portal.

Holcomb announced that state PK-12 schools and higher education institutions can apply for a $61.6 million needs-based grant program to bolster remote learning through device availability, connectivity and educator capacity.  Holcomb extended prohibitions on rental evictions and filing foreclosures through July 31, and on utility service disconnects through August 14.  Holcomb announced a $25 million Indiana COVID-19 Rental Assistance Program.    Iowa Status of Stay-at-Home order    Gov. Kim Reynolds did not issue a statewide stay-at-home order, but signed multiple proclamations continuing the State Public Health Emergency Declaration initially announced on March 17. An April 27 proclamation continued the statewide emergency declaration while loosening some restrictions from May 1 through May 15. Reynolds later extended the proclamation through July 25, but allowed additional businesses and activities to resume before then. As of May 15, restrictions previously loosened only in 77 counties are lifted statewide.  Reopening  Reynolds signed a proclamation allowing hospitals to resume some elective surgeries through a phased approach, and reopening farmers' markets with limited operations, beginning April 27. In 77 of Iowa's 99 counties, restaurants, fitness centers, malls, libraries, race tracks and some retail establishments were allowed to resume limited operations if they implement public health measures, effective May 1. That same proclamation lifted restrictions on religious and spiritual gatherings, if they observe safety precautions. In the 77 counties with relaxed restrictions, social and fraternal clubs were ordered to remain closed except for physically-distant golfing or food and beverage service. In the remaining 22 counties, fitness centers, health clubs and gyms were allowed to reopen on an appointment-only basis for one patron at a time. Malls there can reopen at 50% capacity, but must keep seating and play areas closed. Previously-closed retail stores can open at 50% capacity and in compliance with state guidance. A proclamation effective May 8 permits dental services to resume in compliance with board guidelines and permits additional establishments to resume limited operations with public health measures in place. It also adjusts school start dates, suspends certain requirements for private instruction and interscholastic athletics and provides additional professional licensure relief. Campgrounds, drive-in movie theaters, tanning facilities and medical spas can reopen statewide. A proclamation effective May 15 permits salons, barbershops and massage and tattoo establishments to reopen statewide in a limited fashion, with public health measures in place. It also permits restaurants, fitness centers, libraries and racetracks to reopen in the 22 counties where they were previously closed. As of May 22, movie theaters, zoos, aquariums, museums and wedding reception venues can reopen with public health measures. Swimming pools can also reopen for lap swimming and swimming lessons. State parks will open restrooms, shower buildings and cabins, and campgrounds will reopen with stipulations. Starting May 28, bars and other establishments that serve alcohol can reopen at 50% capacity. As of June 1, schools are able to resume school-sponsored learning and activities, including high school baseball and softball. Beginning June 1, speedways and raceways can open events to spectators, and outdoor performance venues can hold live performances. Casinos, gaming facilities and indoor amusement venues can open with occupancy limits and other safety measures. Socially-distant community, recreational, leisure and athletic gatherings of more than 10 people are allowed. The Iowa Department of Public Health released a three-phase plan for the gradual easing of restrictions in long-term care facilities.   Effective June 12, businesses can operate at full capacity with social distancing, hygiene and public health measures. Swimming pools, indoor playgrounds, theaters and performance venues, senior citizen centers and adult day care facilities can reopen in compliance with state guidance. Vulnerable residents in all counties are encouraged to limit their activities outside of the home.  Testing and tracing  Reynolds announced the launch of ""TestIowa,"" a public-private partnership set to increase the state's COVID-19 testing capacity by up to 3,000 additional tests per day. The state created an online health assessment, which Reynolds is encouraging even asymptomatic individuals to fill out, and is setting up drive-through testing tents. Reynolds said on May 21 that Test Iowa criteria have expanded to include anyone who wants a COVID-19 test.  Relief and resources  The state said existing permits to carry or acquire a firearm will not expire until further notice. An April 10 proclamation introduced additional regulatory relief measures. The provisions give health facilities greater flexibility, remove some in-person regulatory requirements and ""permit community colleges and school districts to adjust to the suspension of in-person instruction."" Iowa Workforce Development issued guidance on April 27 saying Iowans who are idled by temporary coronavirus-related layoffs and who refuse to return to work when recalled by their employer will lose unemployment benefits, with a few exceptions. Reynolds said the moratorium on foreclosures, evictions and other debt collection activities would expire at the end of the day on May 27. Reynolds allocated federal funding to the COVID-19 Iowa Eviction and Foreclosure Prevention Program, which provides short-term assistance to income-eligible renters and homeowners who have lost income due to the pandemic. The state received $26.2 million in federal emergency relief to expand broadband access as part of an effort to facilitate remote learning for K-12 and post-secondary students.   Kansas Status of Stay-at-Home order    Gov. Laura Kelly signed a statewide stay-at-home order that shuts down businesses, government and other operations unless considered essential. People must maintain 6 feet from others in public, and limit gatherings to no more than 10 people. Kelly extended the order through midnight on May 3. Phase one of the state's reopening plan began on May 4, and phase two began May 22. Statewide mandates for travel-related quarantines and public health isolation and quarantine orders remain in effect. Kelly signed an executive order requiring masks to be worn in public spaces and in situations where 6 feet of distance cannot be maintained, effective July 3.   Reopening  On April 30, Kelly introduced her ""Ad Astra"" plan for gradually reopening the economy. The plan requires local governments to operate under a regulatory baseline, while allowing them to impose additional restrictions if necessary. State officials have released reopening guidance for businesses and industries. As of May 26, the Ad Astra plan is a recommendation rather than a statewide order, and individual county health officials can decide how to proceed. Under phase one of the plan, the statewide stay-at-home order was lifted but mass gatherings remained limited to a maximum of 10 people. Restaurants, libraries and child care facilities can open, and must adhere to social distancing guidelines.

On June 9, the state announced it will begin phasing in test scheduling open to all residents, including those who previously completed the Test Nebraska assessment but did not qualify for a test. As part of the plan to gradually ease restrictions on long-term care facilities, the state will help facilitate free baseline testing of residents and staff, and will distribute test kits and personal protective equipment through local health departments.  Relief and resources  Ricketts proclaimed April 10-30 as ""21 Days To Stay Home and Stay Healthy,"" urging Nebraskans to perform their civic duty by further avoiding nonessential errands and limiting social gatherings. The proclamation offers additional guidance for practicing good hygiene and social distancing, directing people to telecommute or else ""socially distance"" their work, avoid visiting long-term care facilities, help children and seniors stay home, and shop alone and only once a week. The ""Six Rules To Keep Nebraska Healthy"" remained in place for the month of May. The state is expanding SNAP benefits by easing certain eligibility requirements. It is also extending recertification periods by six months and providing emergency allotments to SNAP recipients in April and May.

The state Department of Agriculture has enacted temporary regulatory changes allowing restaurants to sell unlabeled packaged foods to customers. An April 15 executive order expands access to child care by waiving some regulations for the Child Care Subsidy Program. Participating providers may now bill the state for days when a child is absent, and participating families may now obtain in-home child care when other options are unavailable. State officials recommended on April 22 that municipalities enact a moratorium on utility disconnects for 45 days or longer, noting that most had already done so.

Reopening  On April 27, Burgum announced that he would lift certain restrictions and implement new guidelines for businesses as they continue or resume operations after the executive order expires on April 30. He has emphasized that the reopening of businesses is voluntary for those that can meet protocols, and is encouraging people to continue teleworking whenever possible. The ""North Dakota Smart Restart"" roadmap offers universal protocols and industry-specific guidance for businesses to protect the health and safety of both workers and customers.

The recommended capacity for banquets and weddings increases to 75% of venue occupancy, capped at 500 attendees. A June 5 executive order modifies restrictions at long-term care facilities, allowing for a phased approach to resuming visitation. The state is encouraging outdoor visitation by appointment with protective measures, and certain long-term care facilities approved for Phase 1 can resume group dining and other activities.  Testing and tracing  Individuals who test positive for COVID-19, and their household members, are ordered to self-quarantine in their place of residence for 14 days, according to an April 6 executive order. Burgum outlined a plan to expand the state's COVID-19 testing capacity, with the goal of performing 1,800 tests per day by April 30. The state is conducting serial COVID-19 testing in targeted settings such as long-term care facilities.  Relief and resources   Burgum issued an executive order waiving the one-week waiting period to obtain unemployment benefits, as the state saw a surge in jobless claims. Burgum signed an order suspending visitation to long-term care facilities, ""except in cases of end-of-life or compassionate care circumstances,"" until further notice.

South Dakota Status of Stay-at-Home order    South Dakota had no statewide stay-at-home order. Gov. Kristi Noem issued an executive order through May 31 that strengthened the language used to require South Dakotans to practice CDC-recommended hygiene practices and social distancing. It also ordered businesses and local and municipal governments to restrict gatherings of 10 or more people, told employers to encourage staff to telework and social distance and required health care organizations to postpone all nonessential elective surgeries. Noem also ordered adults over the age of 65, and anyone with certain underlying medical conditions, in Minnehaha and Lincoln counties to stay home. There are exceptions for critical infrastructure jobs and essential errands. The order expired on May 11, though Noem said she would revisit it if necessary. Noem extended the state of emergency to December 30.  Reopening  On April 28, Noem announced the ""Back to Normal"" plan, which outlines guidance for individuals, schools, employers, health care providers and local governments. She also signed an executive order putting the plan into effect. An executive order offers guidance regarding how the ""Back to Normal"" plan applies to state government. Cabinet secretaries and bureau commissioners have the authority to call employees back to the office, though administrative leave is still allowed for employees who cannot come in and cannot work remotely. Approved out-of-state work-related travel is allowed.  Closed, canceled and delayed  Elections to be held between April 14 and May 26 have been postponed. Requirements that students take national standardized tests have been waived. Visitation to senior care facilities and hospitals remains restricted under the ""Back to Normal"" plan.  Testing and tracing  Officials announced that South Dakota is ramping up testing of vulnerable populations. A four-week plan to test all residents and staff at nursing homes and assisted living facilities statewide began May 18. Noem said the state will also conduct mass testing in some tribal communities, and work with employers of essential and critical infrastructure as it did at Smithfield Foods.  Relief and resources  The state has created a small business economic disaster relief subfund that can make appropriations. Noem signed an executive order removing barriers to licensure for health care professionals and expanding access to telehealth. Noem signed an executive order on April 20 giving hog producers temporarily flexibility in their state and county regulatory operations. At an April 21 press conference, Noem encouraged people not to attend two upcoming auto races that had sold hundreds of tickets, but did not opt to take more restrictive action. The speedways later decided to hold the races without spectators present. The governor's Small Business Relief Fund announced its first 94 recipients, totaling more than $5 million in loans. Noem signed an executive order suspending a statute related to the renewal of certain alcoholic beverage licenses. The state received $9 million in CARES Act funding to help child care programs respond to pandemic-related challenges. Noem announced the Local Government COVID Recovery Fund, which will support cities and counties seeking state reimbursement for eligible pandemic-related expenses.    Wisconsin Status of Stay-at-Home order    On May 13, Wisconsin's Supreme Court overturned the existing stay-at-home order and ruled that all future statewide coronavirus-related restrictions must be approved by the legislature's rule-making committee. In response, some local governments have issued their own stay-at-home orders and announced that the state's order will continue to apply in their jurisdiction. Gov. Tony Evers is urging Wisconsinites to ""continue doing their part"" by staying home, practicing social distancing and limiting travel.  Previously, Evers had extended the statewide stay-at-home order through the morning of May 26. Residents were ordered to stay at their place of residence with the exception of essential activities, and maintain 6 feet of distance from others, and all public or private gatherings of people who are not part of the same living unit were prohibited.  Reopening  The governors of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin announced on April 16 that they will work in close coordination to safely reopen Midwestern states. Evers announced the ""Badger Bounce Back"" plan on April 20. The plan outlines phases and criteria for the incremental reopening of Wisconsin's economy. The state has compiled general and industry-specific guidelines for reopening. An April 27 executive order further eases restrictions on certain businesses. Nonessential businesses can do curbside drop-offs of goods and animals. Rentals of outdoor recreational vehicles like boats and golf carts can resume, and automatic and self-service car washes can operate. All of the businesses must operate ""free of contact with customers"" by taking payments online or by phone; they must also follow disinfecting practices. The Department of Natural Resources reopened 34 state parks and forests on May 1, under special conditions to minimize overcrowding and facilitate social distancing. Camping was prohibited and events were suspended through May 26. It previously closed 40 state parks, forests and recreational areas ""until further notice."" While religious institutions were considered essential under the stay-at-home order, they were required to abide by the 10-person limit. Evers issued guidance encouraging houses of worship to conduct services online, in parking lots with congregants in their cars, or shifts of small groups. A May 11 order allows all standalone and strip mall-based retail stores to offer in-person shopping for up to five customers at a time while enforcing social distancing protocols. It also permits drive-in theaters to resume limited operations.  Closed, canceled and delayed  Public and private K-12 schools are closed to in-person instruction and extracurricular activities for the remainder of the academic year. Evers issued an executive order on April 6, a day before the state's primary election was set to take place, delaying in-person voting to June 9. State Republicans immediately challenged it in Wisconsin Supreme Court, which blocked the delay. That night, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the state could not accept absentee ballots postmarked after its voting day, reversing a lower court decision that would have given Wisconsinites six extra days to vote by mail.  Testing and tracing  Evers announced on May 1 that state officials are working with local health departments to create testing sites in areas lacking access to tests or experiencing high rates of COVID-19. On May 4, Evers announced a plan to further expand the state's COVID-19 testing capacity, with the goal of conducting 85,000 tests per week. Evers also announced a plan to scale up contact tracing efforts, with the goal of having 1,000 tracers statewide. Evers is encouraging anyone who has been in large groups, whether at work or at protests, to get tested.  Relief and resources  Evictions and foreclosures in the state were ordered suspended on March 27. Certain licensing requirements for health care workers were also suspended. Two state-operated voluntary self-isolation facilities will open in Madison and Milwaukee. The state is seeking active and retired health care professionals, as well as individuals who wish to help in non-clinical support positions, to volunteer for the new Wisconsin Emergency Assistance Volunteer Registry. Wisconsin received a donation of 10,000 procedural masks and 1,000 medical outfits from Heilongjiang Province, its sister state in China. Evers announced that $2 million in grants is available for one thousand eligible and ethnically diverse micro-businesses that have suffered losses due to the pandemic. The state received a donation of approximately 210,000 procedural masks from international businesses and the Taiwanese government for distribution to health care and public safety professionals. Evers announced $75 million in assistance for small businesses through the Wisconsin Economic Development Commission's ""We're All In"" initiative, funded largely by federal aid from the CARES Act. Eligible small businesses can apply in June to receive cash grants of $2,500. The Department of Children and Families announced the Child Care Counts initiative, a $51 million emergency payment program to support Wisconsin's early care and education community. Evers announced on June 12 that 2,367 early care and education providers had received more than $32 million, with a second application period open through June 19. Evers announced a $25 million Wisconsin Rental Assistance Program, which will provide direct financial assistance to eligible individuals who have lost income as a result of the pandemic. Evers announced a $1 billion statewide effort to support COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, supply acquisition, emergency operations and community resources, using CARES Act funding. Evers announced an initiative to fight food insecurity and invest in agriculture. A $50 million Wisconsin Farm Support Program will provide direct payments to farmers, while a $15 million Food Security Initiative will support food banks, pantries and nonprofit organizations statewide. Evers announced a $100 million grant program, funded through the CARES Act, that will support providers facing financial hardship during the pandemic. Providers include emergency medical services, home and community-based services and long-term care facilities. The state launched the ""Routes to Recovery: Local Government Aid Grants"" program, a $200 million effort funded by the CARES Act that aims to help local leaders address COVID-19 recovery needs. Of that amount, $10 million will be allocated to Wisconsin's tribal nations. Evers announced that hospitals across the state will receive a total of $40 million in direct payments to help with revenue losses and expenses related to COVID-19. Wisconsin's tax season was extended until July 15, though the state Department of Revenue is encouraging people to file sooner rather than later. Evers announced more than $80 million in financial assistance will go to the state's K-12 schools and institutions of higher education to assist their response to pandemic-related challenges.

Patrick Semansky/AP                    In a Fourth of July speech aimed at commemorating the military on Saturday, President Trump hit on familiar divisive themes, condemning the ""radical left"" and the media, which he accused of ""slander."" During the second annual Salute to America event held on the South Lawn of the White House, the president drew a comparison between historical American wartime victories and stopping the ""radical left."" ""American heroes defeated the Nazis, dethroned the fascists, toppled the communists, saved American values, upheld American principles and chased down the terrorists to the very ends of the Earth,"" the president told attendees. ""We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters and people who in many instances have absolutely no clue what they are doing.""  The Coronavirus Crisis Despite Rising Coronavirus Cases, Trump's Focus Appears To Be Elsewhere  National Trump Flouts Virus Rules, Warns Of 'New Far-Left Fascism' At Mount Rushmore EventTrump also went after protesters who've rallied to take down statues and monuments that honor Confederate leaders and others known to have supported or profited off slavery and racism. ""We will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children or trample on our freedoms,"" he said. Trump said media outlets ""slander"" him and ""falsely and consistently label their opponents as racists."" The president also returned to his call for the creation of a National Garden of American Heroes, for which he signed an executive order on Friday. He said his administration has already selected some 30 ""legends,"" men and women who include: John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, Daniel Boone, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Henry Clay, Davy Crockett, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Benjamin Franklin, Billy Graham, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King Jr., Abraham Lincoln, Douglas MacArthur, Dolley Madison, James Madison, Christa McAuliffe, Audie Murphy, George S. Patton, Ronald Reagan, Jackie Robinson, Betsy Ross, Antonin Scalia, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Harriet Tubman, Booker T. Washington, George Washington, and Orville and Wilbur Wright. The celebration comes as the U.S. sees a surge in coronavirus infections.

Alex Brandon/AP                    President Trump, in a speech Friday at Mount Rushmore that lasted more than 40 minutes, focused on statues and ""cancel culture"" and accused his political opponents of fascism. But he spared just a few words for the pandemic that has killed 130,000 Americans, thanking ""the doctors, nurses and scientists working tirelessly to kill the virus."" And that was it. He gave it a little more attention Saturday night at the White House before a crowd of first responders and their families, touting the number of tests conducted in the United States. ""We show cases, 99% of which are harmless,"" Trump said, adding that the country will have a therapeutic or vaccine solution long before the end of the year. It is unclear what he based that claim on. Even with coronavirus cases spiking from California to Florida, Trump has largely kept his public focus elsewhere: ""law and order,"" ""our heritage,"" represented by statues that are a target of anti-racism protests, and job gains — even as governors find themselves forced to bring back shutdowns of bars, movie theaters and popular beaches.  This year, when coronavirus cases peaked the first time, the White House task force tackling the pandemic met every day and Trump held near-daily televised briefings. Now the task force meets only sporadically, decisions are made locally and Trump is nearly invisible when it comes to talking to the public about the pandemic.  Loading...  Last Thursday, for the first time since late April, Trump returned to the White House press briefing room. He wasn't there to talk about surging coronavirus cases but about the latest jobs report, showing millions of people back at work. ""You are going to have a fantastic third quarter. It'll be a third quarter the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, in my opinion,"" Trump said, bringing his reelection message into the briefing room. ""And the good thing is the numbers will be coming out just prior to the election. So the people will be able to see those numbers.""  Politics In Fourth Of July Remarks, Trump Attacks 'Radical Left' The Coronavirus Crisis Hiring Surged In June With 4.8 Million Jobs Added Before New Spike In InfectionsTrump makes no secret of the fact that for him, in this moment, reelection is at center stage. Acknowledging the difficult reality of the pandemic is hard to sell, so even as recently as a few days ago, Trump said the virus was ""going to sort of just disappear"" — a message that he has repeated since the early days of the pandemic. On the rare occasions when he does talk about the coronavirus, Trump downplays the negatives. The case spikes, he insists, are just embers. ""We have some areas where we're putting out the flames or the fires, and it's working out well,"" Trump said Thursday. Four months from the election, Trump is trailing in every major national poll and in numerous swing-state polls. To propel him to victory in November, he is counting on a strong economic rebound and a pitch that the best is yet to come. ""Trump wants to focus on jobs and the economy,"" said Stephen Moore, who advises the president on economic issues. ""I think most people in the president's campaign and the president himself believe that the economy is what he needs to focus on if he's going to beat [presumptive Democratic nominee] Joe Biden.""

Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images                    But public health experts are sounding the alarm, and governors who had previously resisted mask mandates are now imploring everyone to mask up. ""We are heading in the wrong direction, and we are heading there quickly,"" said Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now heads Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of Vital Strategies, a global health nonprofit. ""What we are seeing in the U.S. today is that the virus has the upper hand, and what we're not seeing is systematic regular information given to Americans about what is happening with the virus and where, what is happening with the response and how can we all make it better."" In recent weeks, Trump has left the delivery of public health messages about the virus to others, including Vice President Pence, who brought back coronavirus task force briefings after more than two months without them. A task force official told NPR that it isn't necessary for the group to meet as frequently as it did in the early days of the pandemic because there are fewer urgent and immediate decisions to be made than when it all began. On Thursday, Pence met with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in Tampa, a hot spot within a hot spot state. The vice president wore a mask as he stepped off Air Force Two and was greeted by a masked DeSantis. Pence's message: ""Just know that if all of us do our part, we'll get through this."" Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, took umbrage at the idea that Trump isn't doing enough on the coronavirus pandemic, saying in a statement: ""Any suggestion that the President is not working around the clock to protect the health and safety of all Americans, lead the whole-of-government response to this pandemic, including expediting vaccine development, and rebuild our economy is utterly false."" During remarks Thursday about the jobs numbers, Trump did briefly come about as close as he ever has to encouraging people to wear masks. He made news, simply by mentioning masks in a list of best practices. ""That includes face covering, social distance, testing and personal hygiene,"" Trump said, reading from remarks. ""Wash your hands."" And just to make sure everyone noticed, after Trump left without taking questions, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pointed to the president's remarks, noting: ""The president specifically put in his speech encouraging Americans to wear a mask."" The question is, if Trump's supporters don't see him wearing a mask, will they believe others who say that doing so is important to slowing the spread of the virus?"

Susan Walsh/AP                    Updated at 5:40 p.m. ET The U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously upheld laws across the country that remove or punish rogue Electoral College delegates who refuse to cast their votes for the presidential candidate they were pledged to support. The decision Monday was a loss for ""faithless electors,"" who argued that under the Constitution they have discretion to decide which candidate to support. Writing for the court, Justice Elena Kagan, in a decision peppered with references to the Broadway show Hamilton and the TV show Veep, said Electoral College delegates have ""no ground for reversing"" the statewide popular vote. That, she said, ""accords with the Constitution — as well as with the trust of the Nation that here, We the People rule."" The decision was a relief to election law experts as well as Democratic and Republican party officials, who have long supported faithless elector laws such as those upheld Monday. If the case had gone the other way, it would have been a ""nightmare scenario"" in which people unhappy with the general election results could ""go after electors and try to threaten them or cajole them or bribe them to vote in a particular way,"" said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine.  Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser echoed those sentiments: ""This was one where I did not want to contemplate what the other consequence would have looked like,"" he said. Even Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, who represented the rogue electors before the Supreme Court, appeared only mildly disappointed at the loss. ""We took this case initially because we just thought this needed to be resolved before it created a constitutional crisis,"" he said. Thirty-two states have some sort sort of faithless elector law, but only 15 of those remove, penalize or simply cancel the votes of the errant electors. The 15 are Michigan, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Indiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, Washington, California, New Mexico, South Carolina, Oklahoma and North Carolina. Although Maine has no such law, the secretary of state has said it has determined a faithless elector can be removed.  Monday's Supreme Court decision, however, is so strong that it would seem to allow states to remove faithless electors even without a state law. Duke University School of Law professor Guy-Uriel Charles said that nonetheless, it would be prudent for states to pass laws to prevent electors from going rogue. ""States certainly would be better off by imposing some statutory basis ... for removing or sanctioning rogue electors,"" Charles said, adding, ""But I don't see anything in this opinion that requires them to do so."" Monday's case began after the 2016 election when a handful of Electoral College delegates pledged to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Colorado and Washington state voted for other individuals, such as Colin Powell or John Kasich.   As Michael Baca, the faithless elector from Colorado, put it in an NPR interview, the idea was to ""reach across the aisle"" to Republican electors in 2016 and try to find a candidate that some Republican delegates would be willing to support other than Donald Trump. Baca was removed on the spot under Colorado's faithless elector law, and the Washington state delegates were fined $1,000 each. In 2019, Washington's law was amended to require that faithless electors be removed as well. On Monday, the Supreme Court put its stamp of approval on either approach, at minimum. Kagan's opinion noted that the original Electoral College system created by the framers of the Constitution failed to anticipate the growth of political parties. By 1796, the first contested election after George Washington's retirement, the system exploded in disarray, with two consecutive Electoral College ""fiascos."" That led to passage of the 12th Amendment in 1804, ""facilitating the Electoral College ... as a mechanism not for deliberation but for party line voting,"" Kagan wrote. Nothing in the Constitution prevents the states from ""taking away presidential electors' voting discretion,"" she said. For centuries, almost all electors have considered themselves bound to vote for the winner of the state popular vote. If the framers of the Constitution had a different idea, she said, they never committed it to the printed page. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined in part by Justice Neil Gorsuch, agreed with the outcome but wrote separately to explain his different reasoning. Rather than interpret the Constitution's sparse language about the Electoral College as authorizing states to impose conditions on electors, Thomas argued that power is reserved to the states by the 10th Amendment. Although many Americans think that they elect the president and vice president, in fact, it is the Electoral College, an arcane intermediary mechanism dreamed up by the Founders, that formally determines who wins the election. The system has been considered a formality because usually the winner of the popular vote also wins the Electoral College. But twice in the past two decades, the unexpected took place: The winner of the popular vote did not become president; instead, the winner in the Electoral College prevailed. Trump, who got nearly 3 million fewer votes overall than Clinton, won the state-by-state allotment of Electoral College votes in 2016 and became president. And in 2000, George W. Bush became president, winning five more Electoral College votes than Al Gore, though Gore won roughly half a million more popular votes. In total, the popular vote winners have failed to win the Electoral College vote on four occasions, the first two occurring during the 1800s.  But the fact that the last two occurred in just the past 20 years has provoked various suggestions for reform, including getting rid of the Electoral College altogether. With the country as polarized as it is, however, that seems unlikely, as it would require a constitutional amendment, and that in turn requires a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress, and approval by three-quarters of the states. Several states have signed on to a proposal to sidestep the Electoral College altogether by joining a ""National Popular Vote Interstate Compact"" to pledge their Electoral College votes to whichever candidate wins the national popular vote, regardless of how the candidates perform in their state. So far, the compact has the support of 15 states and the District of Columbia, making up 196 electoral votes of the 270 needed to win the White House. That scheme, which would only go into effect once enough states have joined to tip the election, would surely be challenged in court as well. Flawed as the Electoral College system may be, at the oral arguments in May, the justices expressed concern about tinkering with laws that bind the delegates to vote for the popular vote winner in their states. Justice Samuel Alito observed that if the popular vote is close, the possibility of ""changing just a few votes"" in the Electoral College would rationally ""prompt the losing party ... to launch a massive campaign to try to influence electors, and there would be a long period of uncertainty about who the next president was going to be."" Similarly, Justice Brett Kavanaugh alluded to what he called ""the chaos principle of judging, which suggests that if it's a close call ... we shouldn't facilitate or create chaos."" None of those concerns surfaced explicitly in Kagan's majority opinion. She instead pointed to the text of the Constitution as well as more than 200 years of history and tradition to make her case.

Susan Walsh/AP                    Updated at 5:40 p.m. ET The U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously upheld laws across the country that remove or punish rogue Electoral College delegates who refuse to cast their votes for the presidential candidate they were pledged to support. The decision Monday was a loss for ""faithless electors,"" who argued that under the Constitution they have discretion to decide which candidate to support. Writing for the court, Justice Elena Kagan, in a decision peppered with references to the Broadway show Hamilton and the TV show Veep, said Electoral College delegates have ""no ground for reversing"" the statewide popular vote. That, she said, ""accords with the Constitution — as well as with the trust of the Nation that here, We the People rule."" The decision was a relief to election law experts as well as Democratic and Republican party officials, who have long supported faithless elector laws such as those upheld Monday. If the case had gone the other way, it would have been a ""nightmare scenario"" in which people unhappy with the general election results could ""go after electors and try to threaten them or cajole them or bribe them to vote in a particular way,"" said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine.  Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser echoed those sentiments: ""This was one where I did not want to contemplate what the other consequence would have looked like,"" he said. Even Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, who represented the rogue electors before the Supreme Court, appeared only mildly disappointed at the loss. ""We took this case initially because we just thought this needed to be resolved before it created a constitutional crisis,"" he said. Thirty-two states have some sort sort of faithless elector law, but only 15 of those remove, penalize or simply cancel the votes of the errant electors. The 15 are Michigan, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Indiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, Washington, California, New Mexico, South Carolina, Oklahoma and North Carolina. Although Maine has no such law, the secretary of state has said it has determined a faithless elector can be removed.  Monday's Supreme Court decision, however, is so strong that it would seem to allow states to remove faithless electors even without a state law. Duke University School of Law professor Guy-Uriel Charles said that nonetheless, it would be prudent for states to pass laws to prevent electors from going rogue. ""States certainly would be better off by imposing some statutory basis ... for removing or sanctioning rogue electors,"" Charles said, adding, ""But I don't see anything in this opinion that requires them to do so."" Monday's case began after the 2016 election when a handful of Electoral College delegates pledged to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Colorado and Washington state voted for other individuals, such as Colin Powell or John Kasich.   As Michael Baca, the faithless elector from Colorado, put it in an NPR interview, the idea was to ""reach across the aisle"" to Republican electors in 2016 and try to find a candidate that some Republican delegates would be willing to support other than Donald Trump. Baca was removed on the spot under Colorado's faithless elector law, and the Washington state delegates were fined $1,000 each. In 2019, Washington's law was amended to require that faithless electors be removed as well. On Monday, the Supreme Court put its stamp of approval on either approach, at minimum. Kagan's opinion noted that the original Electoral College system created by the framers of the Constitution failed to anticipate the growth of political parties. By 1796, the first contested election after George Washington's retirement, the system exploded in disarray, with two consecutive Electoral College ""fiascos."" That led to passage of the 12th Amendment in 1804, ""facilitating the Electoral College ... as a mechanism not for deliberation but for party line voting,"" Kagan wrote. Nothing in the Constitution prevents the states from ""taking away presidential electors' voting discretion,"" she said. For centuries, almost all electors have considered themselves bound to vote for the winner of the state popular vote. If the framers of the Constitution had a different idea, she said, they never committed it to the printed page. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined in part by Justice Neil Gorsuch, agreed with the outcome but wrote separately to explain his different reasoning. Rather than interpret the Constitution's sparse language about the Electoral College as authorizing states to impose conditions on electors, Thomas argued that power is reserved to the states by the 10th Amendment. Although many Americans think that they elect the president and vice president, in fact, it is the Electoral College, an arcane intermediary mechanism dreamed up by the Founders, that formally determines who wins the election. The system has been considered a formality because usually the winner of the popular vote also wins the Electoral College. But twice in the past two decades, the unexpected took place: The winner of the popular vote did not become president; instead, the winner in the Electoral College prevailed. Trump, who got nearly 3 million fewer votes overall than Clinton, won the state-by-state allotment of Electoral College votes in 2016 and became president. And in 2000, George W. Bush became president, winning five more Electoral College votes than Al Gore, though Gore won roughly half a million more popular votes. In total, the popular vote winners have failed to win the Electoral College vote on four occasions, the first two occurring during the 1800s.  But the fact that the last two occurred in just the past 20 years has provoked various suggestions for reform, including getting rid of the Electoral College altogether. With the country as polarized as it is, however, that seems unlikely, as it would require a constitutional amendment, and that in turn requires a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress, and approval by three-quarters of the states. Several states have signed on to a proposal to sidestep the Electoral College altogether by joining a ""National Popular Vote Interstate Compact"" to pledge their Electoral College votes to whichever candidate wins the national popular vote, regardless of how the candidates perform in their state. So far, the compact has the support of 15 states and the District of Columbia, making up 196 electoral votes of the 270 needed to win the White House. That scheme, which would only go into effect once enough states have joined to tip the election, would surely be challenged in court as well. Flawed as the Electoral College system may be, at the oral arguments in May, the justices expressed concern about tinkering with laws that bind the delegates to vote for the popular vote winner in their states. Justice Samuel Alito observed that if the popular vote is close, the possibility of ""changing just a few votes"" in the Electoral College would rationally ""prompt the losing party ... to launch a massive campaign to try to influence electors, and there would be a long period of uncertainty about who the next president was going to be."" Similarly, Justice Brett Kavanaugh alluded to what he called ""the chaos principle of judging, which suggests that if it's a close call ... we shouldn't facilitate or create chaos."" None of those concerns surfaced explicitly in Kagan's majority opinion. She instead pointed to the text of the Constitution as well as more than 200 years of history and tradition to make her case.

""I was a babysitter and I, my senior year of college in particular, I took care of a little baby whose family had just moved to western Massachusetts from New York City.

Interview Highlights  The Ad-Woman Who Made Diamonds 'Forever'The Ad-Woman Who Made Diamonds 'Forever'Download· 14:3714:37On whether she identifies with both of the main characters in the book, mom Elisabeth and caregiver Sam I absolutely do. You know, in some ways I see this book as kind of a conversation with my younger self. I think when you have a friendship between women of different ages, there's a sense of wanting to help the younger woman avoid the mistakes you've made. But they're not those kind of mistakes. They're the ones you have to make, on your own, to really figure out what is coming.  On her treatment of privilege Well, from the very beginning of thinking about this book, I knew that class would play a big role in the story. And, you know, in many ways, this is a book about the gig economy, the shrinking safety net, the sort of weight of student loan debt and other forms of economic hardship on young people. And certainly also the notion that privilege takes many forms. So, Elisabeth is someone who comes from a lot of money, she has not accepted her family money, and therefore feels that she's sort of really above it and views herself actually as self-made, even though she really isn't. But even Sam sort of wrestles with the fact that although she is saddled with a lot of student loan debt and a lot of other things, you know, her education is a form of privilege. Her citizenship is a form of privilege. In many ways, this is a book about the gig economy, the shrinking safety net, the sort of weight of student loan debt and other forms of economic hardship on young people. And certainly also the notion that privilege takes many forms.J. Courtney SullivanOn whether it was uncomfortable to write about class and privilege I don't know that it was uncomfortable because it is so much a part of our culture right now, and it's something we're all thinking about and talking about and trying to do better with. So I feel like I couldn't have written anything else in this particular moment, really. You know, there's a real pushback in the book from Elisabeth's father-in-law, George, that, you know, this country has been emphasizing now for so long the individual, and if you've done something wrong, if you've lost your business — as George has in the book — you must have done something wrong. Where actually it's these systems of power and wealth that are very much stacked against the average person. On Sam's tone-deafness You know, Sam thinks she's doing what's best for her friends, but really she isn't. And you know, what she does, basically, is she has this realization as an undergrad, a very well-meaning undergrad, that the women who work in the dining hall and housekeeping and her college are not well-compensated. You know, in my research, I found that probably every year or two there's a big kerfuffle at an American university where a student kind of realizes, or a group of students realizes, you know, this isn't fair, and they will appeal to the college, and they will write letters and stage protests. But generally, nothing changes. And so I kind of was wondering, well, what does it feel like to be the worker in the dining hall who has to be someone's personal epiphany every three years. On what she learned from writing Sam and Elisabeth I think every novel is kind of a time capsule of where the writer was at that moment. And when I started writing this book, I, to be honest, had a bit of a chip on my shoulder because I was living in New York City. And when you live in New York in your 20s, it's kind of like college, where everyone sort of seems the same. You know, everyone has three roommates. Everyone is hustling. And you reach your 30s and people start getting married, having kids. And suddenly it's like some poet you know is moving into a five million dollar brownstone in Park Slope. And you're like, wait a minute, how did that happen? You kind of begin to realize, oh, you know, some people really come from a lot of money, and some of us are still paying off our college loans and will be forever. So I really had a kind of a chip on my shoulder about that for a while, I must admit, and when I started writing this book, I saw Elisabeth as sort of one of those people. You know, she's not a bad person, but she does sort of have a blind spot to her own wealth. However, I kind of realized what should have been obvious all along, which is that someone in the middle like Sam, or like me, to be honest, is afforded so much privilege just by having an education, even if the education costs you dearly, by being an American citizen and not having to worry and not having to be afraid, as the women in the kitchen are in this book, that if they speak up in their own defense, they or their family members might be retaliated against on that front.

You know, there's a real pushback in the book from Elisabeth's father-in-law, George, that, you know, this country has been emphasizing now for so long the individual, and if you've done something wrong, if you've lost your business — as George has in the book — you must have done something wrong. Where actually it's these systems of power and wealth that are very much stacked against the average person. On Sam's tone-deafness You know, Sam thinks she's doing what's best for her friends, but really she isn't. And you know, what she does, basically, is she has this realization as an undergrad, a very well-meaning undergrad, that the women who work in the dining hall and housekeeping and her college are not well-compensated. You know, in my research, I found that probably every year or two there's a big kerfuffle at an American university where a student kind of realizes, or a group of students realizes, you know, this isn't fair, and they will appeal to the college, and they will write letters and stage protests. But generally, nothing changes. And so I kind of was wondering, well, what does it feel like to be the worker in the dining hall who has to be someone's personal epiphany every three years. On what she learned from writing Sam and Elisabeth I think every novel is kind of a time capsule of where the writer was at that moment. And when I started writing this book, I, to be honest, had a bit of a chip on my shoulder because I was living in New York City. And when you live in New York in your 20s, it's kind of like college, where everyone sort of seems the same. You know, everyone has three roommates. Everyone is hustling. And you reach your 30s and people start getting married, having kids. And suddenly it's like some poet you know is moving into a five million dollar brownstone in Park Slope. And you're like, wait a minute, how did that happen? You kind of begin to realize, oh, you know, some people really come from a lot of money, and some of us are still paying off our college loans and will be forever. So I really had a kind of a chip on my shoulder about that for a while, I must admit, and when I started writing this book, I saw Elisabeth as sort of one of those people. You know, she's not a bad person, but she does sort of have a blind spot to her own wealth. However, I kind of realized what should have been obvious all along, which is that someone in the middle like Sam, or like me, to be honest, is afforded so much privilege just by having an education, even if the education costs you dearly, by being an American citizen and not having to worry and not having to be afraid, as the women in the kitchen are in this book, that if they speak up in their own defense, they or their family members might be retaliated against on that front.

Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images                    Updated 10:45 a.m. ET In an unusually divisive speech for a president on the Fourth of July holiday weekend, President Trump on Friday decried a ""growing danger that threatens every blessing our ancestors fought so hard for."" What is it? Terrorism? Polarization? A lack of trust in institutions? No, Trump said at Mount Rushmore, it's an attempt to erase American history and values. And one part of that, Trump said, is ""cancel culture,"" which he described as ""driving people from their jobs, shaming dissenters, and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees. This is the very definition of totalitarianism ... ."" Cancel culture is a form of group shaming — excluding someone who has done something objectionable or offensive, or withdrawing support from corporations or public leaders for the same reason. It's often pushed from the left of the political spectrum, and there are certainly those who think it's gone too far in some instances. Apart from the merits of the argument, it's ironic that Trump is arguing for inclusivity. The fact is, there are few quicker than Trump to ""cancel"" people for not believing the same as he does — or supporting him faithfully. He just doesn't call it that.  On Monday morning, Trump went further, launching a baseless attack on NASCAR and driver Bubba Wallace, the only Black driver on the circuit. It was reported that a noose was found in Wallace's garage. The FBI determined it was a pull cord. Wallace isn't the one who found it or reported it — and yet Trump is calling it a ""hoax"" and claiming that incident and banning the Confederate flag ""has caused lowest ratings EVER!"" — as if that's what really matters. Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 6, 2020Driver Tyler Reddick responded to Trump, saying, ""We did what was right and we will do just fine without your support."" Trump's emphasis on cancel culture — another element of his broader culture war — can be seen as a distraction, a shiny metal object that Trump wants to use to switch the narrative and see if it sticks because he is struggling in his reelection bid. But there are things in all likelihood that will shape this presidential election far more than ""cancel culture."" Here are six, from public opinion surveys: 58% — Trump's record disapproval: The latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that Trump's disapproval rating was 58%, the highest of his presidency. What's more, 49% ""strongly"" disapprove of the job he's doing. That kind of intense opposition to a president has never been seen before, since polling began.  The Coronavirus Crisis Despite Rising Coronavirus Cases, Trump's Focus Appears To Be Elsewhere America Reckons With Racial Injustice Trump Vows To Veto Defense Bill If It Removes Confederate Names From Military Bases87% — Dissatisfaction is the highest of Trump's presidency: Amid this coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing economic freefall, the Pew Research Center recently found that 87% of Americans are dissatisfied with the direction of the country. And 71% say they are angry, 66% say they're fearful and just 17% are proud of the way things are going. 56% — Trump's (mis)handling of the coronavirus: About 130,000 Americans have now died from the coronavirus. That's about a quarter of all the deaths worldwide. And an average of 56% of people disapprove of his response to the pandemic, the highest level so far. That's taken its toll on Trump politically, especially as states in more politically conservative places are seeing spikes in cases and hospitalizations. Pew found Democrat Joe Biden has an 11-point advantage on who's best to handle the public health impact of the coronavirus pandemic, 52% to 41%. Fifty-two also happens to be the percentage of voters saying they would vote for Biden over Trump in the general election, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. 67% — Making racial tensions worse: A separate NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, conducted in early June, found two-thirds of Americans thought Trump mostly made racial tensions worse. That was after a week of protests and right after law enforcement forcibly removed peaceful protesters outside the White House so he could walk to a partially burned church across the street and pose with a Bible. Yet Trump has only doubled down since then. He's not only pushed a ""law and order"" message but amped it up, saying, for instance, if ""Black Lives Matter"" were painted on New York City's Fifth Avenue, it would be a ""symbol of hate."" Another eyebrow-raising number is the 52% who now say they are in favor of removing Confederate statues from public spaces around the country, according to a Quinnipiac poll. Three years ago, 39% said so. 47% — An economic handling decline: Gallup found that from January to June, the percentage of Americans approving of the job Trump's doing on the economy declined 16 points, from 63% to 47%. The strong economy was undoubtedly buoying Trump to some extent, and now it's not. Trump's lead over Biden on handling of the economy has shrunk, though he's still up on the question in most polls. 35% — Trump's suburban cratering: One set of numbers that will make you rub your eyes is about suburban voters. In 2016, Trump won suburban voters, 49% to 45%, according to exit polls. The latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, though, has Trump losing them by a whopping 60% to 35%. That's not a typo. That's a 29-point swing, from +4 to -25. That kind of cratering in the suburbs is part of why Democrats won the House in 2018, are favored to keep it in 2020, and have made inroads with an unfavorable Senate map. It's tough to see Trump winning reelection without turning things around in the suburbs. Overall, these numbers aren't great for Trump. One saving grace is that his supporters love him — and intensely so. His base is more enthusiastic about voting for him than potential Biden voters are for voting for the former vice president, and that's a wildcard to watch. But while enthusiasm is important, it doesn't always translate into more votes. Reelections, after all, are always about the sitting president. Trump may wind up driving his base out to vote, but also Democrats in opposition to him.  5 things to watch this week: Enlarge this image                Trump meets with New Jersey Rep.

Woke up this morning ... and there were more elections on Tuesday: There are primaries in two states, New Jersey and Delaware. The race to watch is in New Jersey's 2nd Congressional District. Democratic candidates are vying to take on Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who switched parties from Democrat to Republican during Trump's impeachment. Five Democrats are on the ballot, and the race is largely between Amy Kennedy and Brigid Callahan Harrison. Kennedy, a former educator, is a member of the politically elite Kennedy family. (She's married to former Rep. Patrick Kennedy.) She also has the endorsement of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. But Harrison has the endorsement of South Jersey power broker George Norcross and state Senate President Steve Sweeney.

It's his first attempt at a rally since his underwhelming (indoor) event in Tulsa, Okla. Trump's Florida fundraiser is reportedly for $580,600 per couple. Trump and the Republican National Committee trailed Biden and the Democratic National Committee in fundraising, $141 million to $131 million, in June. 3. Awaiting more key Supreme Court decisions: There are more decisions coming from the Supreme Court — as early as Monday — including on whether Trump can block disclosure of his financial records and whether lay teachers at parochial schools are protected by the civil rights laws. 4. The Pentagon and protests: The hearing to watch this week on Capitol Hill involves the Department of Defense's role in civilian law enforcement. Slated to testify Thursday before the House Armed Services Committee are Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Milley last month said he regretted his role in Trump's walk to the partially burned church across the street from the White House. And Esper broke with the president and said, ""The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations now."" 5. Mexico's president will visit the White House: In his first U.S. trip, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador will visit Washington Wednesday to commemorate the signing of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada, or USMCA, trade agreement. López Obrador is seen as friendlier to Trump than past Mexican presidents, and they also share another thing in common — a dislike of the media. He wondered aloud this weekend of what he calls the ""corrupt media"": ""How much are they paid to attack me?""

And one part of that, Trump said, is ""cancel culture,"" which he described as ""driving people from their jobs, shaming dissenters, and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees. This is the very definition of totalitarianism ... ."" Cancel culture is a form of group shaming — excluding someone who has done something objectionable or offensive, or withdrawing support from corporations or public leaders for the same reason. It's often pushed from the left of the political spectrum, and there are certainly those who think it's gone too far in some instances. Apart from the merits of the argument, it's ironic that Trump is arguing for inclusivity. The fact is, there are few quicker than Trump to ""cancel"" people for not believing the same as he does — or supporting him faithfully. He just doesn't call it that.  On Monday morning, Trump went further, launching a baseless attack on NASCAR and driver Bubba Wallace, the only Black driver on the circuit. It was reported that a noose was found in Wallace's garage. The FBI determined it was a pull cord. Wallace isn't the one who found it or reported it — and yet Trump is calling it a ""hoax"" and claiming that incident and banning the Confederate flag ""has caused lowest ratings EVER!"" — as if that's what really matters. Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 6, 2020Driver Tyler Reddick responded to Trump, saying, ""We did what was right and we will do just fine without your support."" Trump's emphasis on cancel culture — another element of his broader culture war — can be seen as a distraction, a shiny metal object that Trump wants to use to switch the narrative and see if it sticks because he is struggling in his reelection bid. But there are things in all likelihood that will shape this presidential election far more than ""cancel culture."" Here are six, from public opinion surveys: 58% — Trump's record disapproval: The latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that Trump's disapproval rating was 58%, the highest of his presidency. What's more, 49% ""strongly"" disapprove of the job he's doing. That kind of intense opposition to a president has never been seen before, since polling began.  The Coronavirus Crisis Despite Rising Coronavirus Cases, Trump's Focus Appears To Be Elsewhere America Reckons With Racial Injustice Trump Vows To Veto Defense Bill If It Removes Confederate Names From Military Bases87% — Dissatisfaction is the highest of Trump's presidency: Amid this coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing economic freefall, the Pew Research Center recently found that 87% of Americans are dissatisfied with the direction of the country. And 71% say they are angry, 66% say they're fearful and just 17% are proud of the way things are going. 56% — Trump's (mis)handling of the coronavirus: About 130,000 Americans have now died from the coronavirus. That's about a quarter of all the deaths worldwide. And an average of 56% of people disapprove of his response to the pandemic, the highest level so far. That's taken its toll on Trump politically, especially as states in more politically conservative places are seeing spikes in cases and hospitalizations. Pew found Democrat Joe Biden has an 11-point advantage on who's best to handle the public health impact of the coronavirus pandemic, 52% to 41%. Fifty-two also happens to be the percentage of voters saying they would vote for Biden over Trump in the general election, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. 67% — Making racial tensions worse: A separate NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, conducted in early June, found two-thirds of Americans thought Trump mostly made racial tensions worse. That was after a week of protests and right after law enforcement forcibly removed peaceful protesters outside the White House so he could walk to a partially burned church across the street and pose with a Bible. Yet Trump has only doubled down since then. He's not only pushed a ""law and order"" message but amped it up, saying, for instance, if ""Black Lives Matter"" were painted on New York City's Fifth Avenue, it would be a ""symbol of hate."" Another eyebrow-raising number is the 52% who now say they are in favor of removing Confederate statues from public spaces around the country, according to a Quinnipiac poll. Three years ago, 39% said so. 47% — An economic handling decline: Gallup found that from January to June, the percentage of Americans approving of the job Trump's doing on the economy declined 16 points, from 63% to 47%. The strong economy was undoubtedly buoying Trump to some extent, and now it's not. Trump's lead over Biden on handling of the economy has shrunk, though he's still up on the question in most polls. 35% — Trump's suburban cratering: One set of numbers that will make you rub your eyes is about suburban voters. In 2016, Trump won suburban voters, 49% to 45%, according to exit polls. The latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, though, has Trump losing them by a whopping 60% to 35%. That's not a typo. That's a 29-point swing, from +4 to -25. That kind of cratering in the suburbs is part of why Democrats won the House in 2018, are favored to keep it in 2020, and have made inroads with an unfavorable Senate map. It's tough to see Trump winning reelection without turning things around in the suburbs. Overall, these numbers aren't great for Trump. One saving grace is that his supporters love him — and intensely so. His base is more enthusiastic about voting for him than potential Biden voters are for voting for the former vice president, and that's a wildcard to watch. But while enthusiasm is important, it doesn't always translate into more votes. Reelections, after all, are always about the sitting president. Trump may wind up driving his base out to vote, but also Democrats in opposition to him.  5 things to watch this week: Enlarge this image                Trump meets with New Jersey Rep.

Five Democrats are on the ballot, and the race is largely between Amy Kennedy and Brigid Callahan Harrison. Kennedy, a former educator, is a member of the politically elite Kennedy family. (She's married to former Rep. Patrick Kennedy.) She also has the endorsement of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy.

Dominic Valente/Hulu                    Growing up in Queens in the 1970s, Padma Lakshmi remembers eating a spaghetti dish her mother made with upma, an Indian porridge. The Top Chef host and executive producer, who came to the U.S. from India at age 4, says such culinary mash-ups are common in immigrant kitchens.  ""Immigrant foods are really interesting, because they're this third thing: They're not traditionally like the food in the countries of origin, but they're not totally Westernized,"" she says. ""A lot of that, of course, happens because of necessity:  When immigrants come here, typically, for the most part, both parents have to work and so they streamline the cooking."" Lakshmi started out as a model and actress, never intending to have a career in food. But she loved to cook and to collect and write down recipes — especially from her relatives. She decided to pitch a cookbook, Easy Exotic, and was surprised when the publisher signed on. ""I think they wanted to capitalize on the fact that everyone does want to know what a model eats,"" she says.   Television 'Taste The Nation' Proves Who's At The Heart Of American Food: ImmigrantsMore books followed, including the 2016 memoir, Love, Loss, and What We Ate. Now, as the host and creator of Hulu series Taste the Nation, Lakshmi travels around the U.S. to learn how foods from different cultures contribute to American cuisine. Among the places she visits: New York, to talk to her own mother about finding Indian ingredients and produce in Queens decades ago.   Interview Highlights On being one of the only South Asian models in American and European fashion magazines  I think that was part of my appeal. I really didn't start to feel attractive until I went to Europe. I knew I had a pretty face, or whatever, all growing up. But I didn't feel like I was beautiful, or that kind of beautiful, until I went to Spain and until this person sort of ""discovered"" me, for lack of a better word, and told me that I could model it. And that happened a couple of times in my career. ... I have a big scar on my arm, which is seven inches long from a car accident I had at 14. I started modeling before the days of retouching. So I got really good at covering it with makeup, but still, it didn't dawn on me that I could actually make a living from my looks. So the fact that it happened at all was a shock to me. ... I was always the only Indian girl in any casting I went to. And I do think that a lot of the attention I got was because there were no other Indian models. I mean, since then, there are many Indian models and they've done way more work than I ever did as a model. But I think just being the first gave me a little bit of a cachet.  'Love, Loss' And Spicy Pickles In Padma Lakshmi's New MemoirOn feeling better about her body with age It's really funny, because when you're a brown person and you live in a white world and you see nothing but white images on billboards, on the covers and inside magazines, on TV, you kind of internalize a subconscious self-loathing about your skin color. And, of course, in Indian culture, there's a ton of colorism. I remember my grandmother always admonishing me to take an umbrella outside so that I wouldn't get too much sun. We kids, especially the girls, were discouraged from going out into the sun to play from the hours of 11:30 to 4:30. And to this day, I still have problems sitting in the sun or playing or in or swimming in the sun because I just feel like it doesn't seem right. I mean, on the one hand, I think it saved me because they don't have a lot of sun damage for my age. But on the other hand, those things that get told to you as you're a young girl and a teenager, they stick with you all your life. And now, you know, at almost 50 years of age, I feel so much better about my body and I feel better about my physical self than I ever have. On the car accident she survived at 14 and the affect that had on her faith We were driving on a Sunday and we were on the highway and we were rear-ended and we fell down an embankment and we were trapped in the car. We were cut out of the car by something called the jaws of life, which are big, huge metal cutters. And my parents were airlifted to one hospital and I was taken by ambulance to another. I fractured my hip and I broke my right upper arm, or humerus bone. I also broke my hand because at some point my hand went through the windshield. ... My mother broke five ribs and her sternum and her arm as well. And my stepfather broke his leg in four places and his hip in two. It was horrible. We were all homebound and in bed for months afterwards. ...  I did lose faith. I think I always vaguely believed in God and I went to the temple when my mother took me. But I've always been a very secular person. ... I didn't know what to make of it. ... It was a very, very, very bad car accident. I mean, if you saw the pictures of the car afterward, your stomach would turn. You would think no one could get out of that car accident alive. And yet, here we are. My mom chooses to think of it as, ""Well, it was God that saved us from dying in that car accident."" Whereas I said, ""If there's a real God and there's any omnipotence to them, why did they just prevent it in the first place?""  On being sent back to India at age 7, shortly after telling her mother that her stepfather's brother had touched her inappropriately I think my mom just wanted to get me out of this situation quickly.

Interview Highlights On being one of the only South Asian models in American and European fashion magazines  I think that was part of my appeal. I really didn't start to feel attractive until I went to Europe. I knew I had a pretty face, or whatever, all growing up.

And that happened a couple of times in my career. ... I have a big scar on my arm, which is seven inches long from a car accident I had at 14. I started modeling before the days of retouching. So I got really good at covering it with makeup, but still, it didn't dawn on me that I could actually make a living from my looks. So the fact that it happened at all was a shock to me. ... I was always the only Indian girl in any casting I went to. And I do think that a lot of the attention I got was because there were no other Indian models. I mean, since then, there are many Indian models and they've done way more work than I ever did as a model. But I think just being the first gave me a little bit of a cachet.  'Love, Loss' And Spicy Pickles In Padma Lakshmi's New MemoirOn feeling better about her body with age It's really funny, because when you're a brown person and you live in a white world and you see nothing but white images on billboards, on the covers and inside magazines, on TV, you kind of internalize a subconscious self-loathing about your skin color. And, of course, in Indian culture, there's a ton of colorism. I remember my grandmother always admonishing me to take an umbrella outside so that I wouldn't get too much sun. We kids, especially the girls, were discouraged from going out into the sun to play from the hours of 11:30 to 4:30. And to this day, I still have problems sitting in the sun or playing or in or swimming in the sun because I just feel like it doesn't seem right. I mean, on the one hand, I think it saved me because they don't have a lot of sun damage for my age. But on the other hand, those things that get told to you as you're a young girl and a teenager, they stick with you all your life. And now, you know, at almost 50 years of age, I feel so much better about my body and I feel better about my physical self than I ever have. On the car accident she survived at 14 and the affect that had on her faith We were driving on a Sunday and we were on the highway and we were rear-ended and we fell down an embankment and we were trapped in the car. We were cut out of the car by something called the jaws of life, which are big, huge metal cutters. And my parents were airlifted to one hospital and I was taken by ambulance to another. I fractured my hip and I broke my right upper arm, or humerus bone. I also broke my hand because at some point my hand went through the windshield. ... My mother broke five ribs and her sternum and her arm as well. And my stepfather broke his leg in four places and his hip in two. It was horrible.

But I've always been a very secular person. ... I didn't know what to make of it. ... It was a very, very, very bad car accident. I mean, if you saw the pictures of the car afterward, your stomach would turn. You would think no one could get out of that car accident alive. And yet, here we are.

Alex Wong/Getty Images                    Updated at 2:40 p.m. A federal judge has ruled that the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline must be emptied for now while the Army Corps of Engineers produces an environmental review. In a decision posted Monday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said that it was clear shutting down the pipeline will cause disruption. But he said that ""the seriousness of the Corps' deficiencies outweighs the negative effects of halting the oil flow"" during the estimated 13 months it will take to complete the environmental impact statement. The court vacated the Corps' decision to grant federal approval for the project, and will require the pipeline to be emptied within 30 days. Boasberg, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, ordered the Corps in March to conduct a full environmental impact analysis. He said that the Corps had made a ""highly controversial"" decision in approving federal permits for the project. Among other things, he said the Corps had failed to answer major questions about the risks of oil spills.  Members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation lies downstream of the pipeline, have been fighting against its construction for years. Crude oil began flowing through the pipeline in 2017. The $3.8 billion pipeline stretches more than 1,100 miles from North Dakota to Illinois, transporting 570,000 barrels of oil per day.

Alex Wong/Getty Images                    Updated at 2:40 p.m. A federal judge has ruled that the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline must be emptied for now while the Army Corps of Engineers produces an environmental review. In a decision posted Monday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said that it was clear shutting down the pipeline will cause disruption. But he said that ""the seriousness of the Corps' deficiencies outweighs the negative effects of halting the oil flow"" during the estimated 13 months it will take to complete the environmental impact statement. The court vacated the Corps' decision to grant federal approval for the project, and will require the pipeline to be emptied within 30 days. Boasberg, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, ordered the Corps in March to conduct a full environmental impact analysis. He said that the Corps had made a ""highly controversial"" decision in approving federal permits for the project. Among other things, he said the Corps had failed to answer major questions about the risks of oil spills.  Members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation lies downstream of the pipeline, have been fighting against its construction for years. Crude oil began flowing through the pipeline in 2017. The $3.8 billion pipeline stretches more than 1,100 miles from North Dakota to Illinois, transporting 570,000 barrels of oil per day.

He was already becoming known as a songwriter as well; he co-wrote an Elvis Presley song, ""It Hurts Me,"" in 1964. By the  late 1960s, he was already becoming an important link between country music and artists outside the country and Southern-rock spheres. He played guitar and bass guitar on Bob Dylan's 1969 project Nashville Skyline, and later worked with Leonard Cohen, George Harrison and others. He and his band also appeared in the 1980 film Urban Cowboy. As the bandleader of the Charlie Daniels Band, he began hosting the Volunteer Jam in 1974 in Nashville. Over the years, this wide-ranging festival featured artists like John Prine, Lynyrd Skynyrd, James Brown, Carl Perkins, Emmylou Harris and Stevie Ray Vaughan.

Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images                    Uber is buying the delivery app Postmates, bolstering its food-delivery business at a time when few people are hailing rides. The $2.65 billion all-stock deal is a sign of how Uber's business model has been turned upside down as customers have stayed home during the coronavirus pandemic. Demand for rides — by far Uber's biggest business — plunged 75% in the second quarter from a year ago, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told Wall Street analysts in a conference call on Monday discussing the deal.  The Coronavirus Crisis As Restaurants Across The Country Close Their Doors, Deliveries Pick UpIn contrast, orders for its Uber Eats food delivery service doubled during the same three-month period. ""Consumers and restaurants have been shifting towards delivery before COVID-19,"" Khosrowshahi said. ""But the pandemic has accelerated these trends, rapidly attracting new customers and restaurants."" While Uber Eats is already the second-largest food delivery service in the US, according to data from Edison Trends, Postmates has a strong hold in major Western markets, including Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas. Combined, Uber Eats and Postmates will have a 37% market share — narrowing in but still clearly behind the biggest app, DoorDash. It has 45% of the U.S. market.   Loading...  In a written announcement, Uber noted Postmates had strong relationships with small- and medium-sized restaurants. It said it will keep the Postmates app running even after the purchase is finalized. Khosrowshahi said Uber is looking to capitalize on surging demand for delivery of all kinds, noting that Postmates has pushed into delivering items such as alcohol, groceries and pharmacy items. ""The vision for us is to become an everyday service,"" he said. But the deal will not stop Uber, which continues to report large losses, from bleeding cash. It and rival food-delivery apps spend a lot on discounts to attract customers. The tough conditions in the food-delivery market have spurred a race for scale. Last month, Grubhub, the U.S.'s third-largest delivery app, was snapped up by Just Eat Takeaway, a European company, for $7.3 billion. Uber had considered buying Grubhub itself. Less than a year ago, DoorDash bought another smaller app, Caviar. ""There's a battle royale going on in food delivery,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. That battle, he added, is good news for customers' wallets, as the apps compete to offer lower prices.   The Coronavirus Crisis Restaurants Are Desperate — But You May Not Be Helping When You Use Delivery AppsBut some restaurants say they have been more hurt than helped by the growing popularity of delivery. Apps charge between 20% to 40% in commission per order. To help restaurants, several cities, from New York to Seattle, have set caps on how much the apps can charge to deliver meals. The impact on Uber drivers is not clear. Many have turned to food delivery during the pandemic to make up for the loss of rides, said Harry Campbell, a driver who runs the popular blog The Rideshare Guy. ""Our top content on the blog and on the YouTube channel is all food delivery,"" he said. ""Everyone is signing up or trying to understand it and the earnings potential."" Uber says the Postmates deal will help drivers by giving them another way to earn money when ride-hailing is slow. The company says drivers also can combine multiple deliveries in a single trip, increasing efficiency and earning more money per trip. But Campbell cautioned that the delivery boom is not a panacea for drivers whose income has been decimated by the pandemic. Many drivers are already feeling squeezed, he said, because transporting food brings in less money than transporting people. ""When you can go work for Uber Eats or DoorDash or Caviar or Postmates, you can kind of compare the various offers. You can see who's offering the best bonuses ... And you can kind of hold each company accountable,"" Campbell said. Consolidation ""means there will just be less options for [drivers] and likely earnings will suffer because of that,"" he added.

Peter Dazeley/Getty Images                    By now, it's common knowledge that the coronavirus can be spread by being in close contact with someone who's infected and then breathing in their respiratory droplets. Or by touching a contaminated surface and rubbing your eyes, nose or mouth.  An open letter signed by 239 researchers addressed to the World Health Organization, published Monday in Clinical Infectious Diseases, calls for attention and guidance around a third route of transmission: tiny respiratory particles that float in the air and are called aerosols. They could be responsible for infecting someone who comes along and breathes them in. Researchers are actively debating the importance of aerosol transmission and whether precautionary approaches should be taken even without clear answers about its role in the spread of the coronavirus. ""The ratio is something we need to figure out,"" says Kimberly Prather, an atmospheric chemist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who signed the letter to WHO. Here's what we know about the different modes of transmission:  Droplet What it is: A microscopic virus-filled particle of breath or spittle, around 5 to 10 microns — about the size of a red blood cell — that comes out of the nose or mouth of an infected individual when they breathe, speak, cough or sneeze. Droplets generally fall to the ground within a few feet of the person who expels them.   How a virus could spread this way: Through what researchers call ""the respiratory route."" Virus-laden droplets are expelled from the nose or mouth of an infected person and find their way into nearby eyes, noses and mouths, ""like if you're standing next to your kid and they cough in your face,"" says Seema Lakdawala, a flu researcher at the University of Pittsburgh. How much does it contribute to the spread? Directly coming into contact with respiratory droplets is currently considered the most frequent mode of transmission, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO.  Aerosol What it is: A virus-packed particle, smaller than 5 microns, that's also expelled from an infected person's mouth when breathing, speaking, coughing or sneezing. Unlike a droplet, smaller aerosol particles can remain suspended in the air.  ""They'll continue to float and follow the air streams in a room,"" Prather says. How a virus could spread this way: Through the respiratory route in which a person breathes in clouds of tiny virus particles that have accumulated and may be traveling on air currents. How much does it contribute to the spread? It's an open question that begs more research. ""Aerosols probably have some contribution toward spread, but we don't know to what extent and what situations are most relevant,"" says Abraar Karan, a physician at Harvard Medical School who treats coronavirus patients. Viral spread via air currents has been documented in certain indoor environments: at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where people sitting downstream from an air conditioner caught COVID-19, and at a March choir practice in Washington state, where many choir members got sick with coronavirus after likely breathing in tiny airborne particles generated by individuals who were infected but symptom-free at the time. What's still unclear is how long the virus lingers in the air, how far it travels (possibly through a room but not down the street) and how commonly it spreads this way.  Fomite What it is: An object covered with virus particles, possibly because someone recently sneezed or coughed respiratory droplets onto it, or swiped a germ-covered hand on it. A countertop or a phone could become a fomite in that same manner. The particles could survive from several hours to several days.  Goats and Soda Essential Vocab For COVID-19: From Asymptomatic To ZoonoticHow a virus could spread this way: Through indirect transmission if people touch the surface of a virus-covered object, pick up the virus on their hands and then introduce the virus to their eyes, nose or mouth.

This page is updated regularly.  More than 2.5 million people in the U.S. have tested positive for the coronavirus and more than 125,000 have died. Though growth in new cases slowed in late spring, by mid-June new cases began to trend upward nationally. In the graphics below, explore the trend in new cases in your state to see whether cases are rising, falling or staying level. You can view the data via a heat map (immediately below), a curve chart and a table with details on each state's case trends over the last three weeks. Or to see states' total cases and deaths on a map, click here.  Loading...  The following chart displays states' trends in new daily case counts, total cases, and per capita totals. To compare state outbreaks, the trend lines for average new daily cases are graphed against each state's total case count to date. This highlights a state's daily growth relative to the overall size of its outbreak.  Shots - Health News What Do Coronavirus Racial Disparities Look Like State By State?  Shots - Health News As States Reopen, Do They Have The Workforce They Need To Stop Coronavirus Outbreaks?When both new and total case counts grow quickly, the curve bends upward. As cases slow, the curve levels or bends down. In New York, site of the country's largest outbreak, the state's curve rose sharply before reaching over 170,000 total cases in April. Since then, new cases have fallen from about 10,000 per day in mid-April to fewer than 700 per day in late June.   Some states, such as Hawaii, have declined to just a dozen new cases per day, while others are growing. Arizona, which had leveled off at around 15,000 total cases in May, saw a sudden sharp spike in new cases in June.  Loading...  The coronavirus has hit some states much harder than others. For much of the pandemic, a large share of U.S. cases have been centered around New York City. As of early June, New York state, Connecticut and New Jersey accounted for about 30% of total cases in the nation and 42% of deaths, although new cases have been dropping in these three states. Across the country, other large, populous states such as California, Illinois and Texas have high totals as well. Some smaller states have had a heavy burden of disease relative to their population size, such as Nebraska and Iowa, which have high case counts per capita, and Louisiana and Michigan which have a high death count per capita.

Harvard Global Health Institute/Microsoft AI/Screenshot by NPR                    Updated 8:15 p.m. ET How severe is the spread of COVID-19 in your community? If you're confused, you're not alone. Though state and local dashboards provide lots of numbers, from case counts to deaths, it's often unclear how to interpret them — and hard to compare them to other places. ""There hasn't been a unified, national approach to communicating risk, says Danielle Allen, a professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University. ""That's made it harder for people,"" she says. Allen, along with researchers at the Harvard Global Health Institute, is leading a collaboration of top scientists at institutions around the country who have joined forces to create a unified set of metrics for the coronavirus pandemic, including a shared definition of risk levels — and tools for communities to fight the virus. The collaboration launched these tools Wednesday, including a new, online risk-assessment map that allows people to check the state or the county where they live and see a COVID-19 risk rating of green, yellow, orange or red. The risk levels are based upon the number of new daily cases per 100,000 people.  To find your county's risk level, explore the county-level map here.A community that has fewer than one daily new case per 100,000 is green. One to 9 is yellow; between 10 and 24 is orange; and 25 and above puts you in the red. ""When you get into that orange and red zone it means, in all likelihood, you're seeing a lot of velocity, a kind of fast upward trend,"" Allen says. As of Wednesday, over 200 U.S. counties were in the red zone, with populations totaling more than 36 million people. This is by no means the only attempt to categorize risk levels across the United States. There are a number of frameworks out there using different measures. And that can lead to confusion, says Allen. ""What we really need is a shared vocabulary and shared way of presenting data across jurisdictions,"" she says. This effort represents the consensus of eight institutions and more than a dozen individual experts who have agreed on these metrics.  Loading...  There are other important metrics when it comes to tracking the spread and severity of COVID-19. Local government leaders need to know how many people are dying and how many people are hospitalized. They need to know how many tests are coming back positive in an area. (The lower the positivity rate, the more likely a community is testing enough to accurately detect the spread of the virus.) But the group settled on tying the alert level to numbers of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000, because that's a good indicator to show the current picture of outbreaks and compare them in a consistent way. It's a standard way to measure the risk against the total population.  Shots - Health News Drill Down To County Level And The U.S. COVID-19 Outbreak Looks Even Worse Shots - Health News As Coronavirus Surges, How Much Testing Does Your State Need To Subdue The Virus?""It allows you to compare a rural area in upstate New York compared to New York City and have an apples-to-apples comparison for relative impact and relative caseload,"" says Ellie Graeden of Talus Analytics and the Center for Global Health, Science and Security at Georgetown University, which is part of the convergence group that developed the metrics. Also, by sticking with a standard, core metric you can compare trends over time. ""You want to know whether things are going up or down,"" Allen says. For the public, this means you can now compare the case incidence where you live to that of, say, a nearby county where you're considering going on an errand. Or the county where your parents live if you're considering a visit. It gives you a way to assess your community's risk level compared to others, at a glance, and modify your behavior accordingly. For policy-makers, the risk levels are meant to signal the intensity of the effort needed to control COVID-19 and to trigger specific interventions. The collaborative released guidance for how state and local leaders should manage their response, depending on their risk level. ""As this [pandemic] unfolded, a lot of us were waiting for the federal government to stand up and really produce ... some practical guidance on how those at the state and local level should be responding,"" says Graeden. But in the absence of that clear guidance, this collaboration aims to fill the void. If a jurisdiction is at the green level, it's on track for containing the virus. At yellow, a community should implement measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing and have an active program of testing, contact tracing and isolation — including targeted testing of those in high-risk environments. Orange is considered ""dangerous"" and requires surging testing and contact tracing efforts — or if that's not possible, it may call for stay-home orders. At the red level, ""jurisdictions have reached a tipping point for uncontrolled spread,"" according to the collaborative's guidance. At this level, ""you really need to be back at a stay-at-home [advisory]"" Graeden says. Currently, two states — Arizona and Florida — are at the red level and 14 are orange. Only Hawaii is green. But there's a great deal of variation county by county. In orange Texas, for instance, more than 20 counties are red. The idea is to take some of the guesswork out of the policy response at a local level, says Graeden, and offer a more standardized way to communicate the risk and the response options. ""We've all modified our metrics to align more accurately across the different platforms,"" she says. ""We're now communicating and all agreeing on the same basic thresholds for the types of actions that need to be taken. "" The shared metrics and guidance will be incorporated into a number of initiatives and sites focused on COVID-19 response, including Covidlocal.org, led by a group of disease outbreak experts and former public health officials, and CovidActNow, led by former technology executives and a group of academics. The convergence group hopes to see it adopted more widely and used by local and state governments."

Dental offices were largely shuttered across the United States after being advised in March by the American Dental Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to close their practices to all but emergency care. Many closed entirely. The hope was that by allowing dentists to continue to treat serious cases — such as intense tooth pain and infections — those patients would stay out of hospital emergency rooms, where medical workers were busy with severely ill coronavirus patients. And because the personal protective gear dentists and other health care providers need was in short supply, routine dental checkups and cleanings were deemed nonessential at least initially.  Shots - Health News My Gym Is Reopening. Is It Safe To Work Out There? Shots - Health News Is It Safe Yet To Get Your Physical Or A Dental Checkup?More recently though, the restrictions against routine care have been loosened in many places. So, is it really safe to go to the dentist now? Can't completely eliminate the coronavirus transmission risk  Dr. Gregory Poland, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic and a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, says he thinks some infections in dental settings are likely to be inevitable. ""But the hope is that recommendations for their practices that all dentists should be following will mitigate that risk,"" Poland says. The concern about the risk of transmission of COVID-19 during a visit to the dentist is understandable. Dental settings have ""unique characteristics that warrant specific infection control considerations,"" says Michele Neuburger, a dental officer for the CDC's Division of Oral Health and a member of the CDC's COVID-19 Response Infection Prevention Control Team. ""Dental health care personnel use instruments such as dental [drills], ultrasonic scalers and air-water syringes that create a visible spray that can contain particle droplets of water, saliva, blood, microorganisms and other debris,"" Neuburger says.   Coronavirus Live Updates CDC Advice On Surface Spread Of COVID-19 'Has Not Changed,' Agency SaysLarge droplets can land directly on others in the exam room and can contaminate frequently touched surfaces. The spray could also include small ""aerosolized"" droplets of COVID-19 if a patient has the virus. And those droplets can remain in the air for up to three hours, according to some estimates, and potentially spread the virus to dental staff or the next patient unless stringent precautions — such as personal protective equipment for staff and disinfection of the treatment room, instruments and surfaces between patients — aren't taken. No cases of COVID-19 traced to dental offices so far Despite these potential risks, the good news is that both the World Health Organization and the CDC say there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 transmitted in a dental office so far. And that includes follow-up by the CDC of news reports suggesting such infections, Neuburger says. In mid-May, in sync with the American Dental Association, the CDC issued more guidance for dental practices, which continues to be periodically updated.  Shots - Health News A Good Dentist Is Hard To Find In Rural America Shots - Health News No-Drill Dentistry: Fluoride Treatments Can Prevent Cavities In AdultsRon Greenberg, 62, a computer science professor at Loyola University in Chicago, returned to his dentist in early June. ""I have been nervous about going anywhere since mid-March,"" he says. But when he finally screwed up the courage for his delayed checkup, the dental office had ""lots of procedures in place"" that made him feel better. A member of the staff called with a list of questions about his health a few days before the appointment, then again on the day of his checkup. Greenberg was told to call the receptionist from his car when he arrived and then wait to let a staffer open the office's front door — so he didn't even need to touch a doorknob. ""They led me straight to the hand sanitizer,"" he says. ""Next was a temperature check. ... Everybody wore masks until I had to take mine off for them to work on me. And the hygienist and dentist had full face shields for when they were working close in."" Greenberg says he was confident enough after experiencing all those extra precautions to schedule a follow-up appointment for several days later to repair a chipped tooth. CDC guidelines: Avoid powered tools where possible Greenberg's visit included many of the precautions recommended by the CDC. These, edited for clarity, include:  Screen patients before each appointment, and when they arrive, for symptoms of COVID-19 — such as cough and fever — and postpone if they have symptoms that could indicate they have the virus. Use each patient's car or a spot outside the office as the waiting room. Remove items such as toys, magazines and coffee stations [which can be infection sources] from waiting rooms. Require masks for patients and anyone with them while in the office area and immediately after procedures and checkups. Place a plastic or glass barrier between patient and reception staff. Avoid using powered tools when possible — some practices no longer use a polisher for teeth cleanings, for example. Leave out only the tools needed for each individual patient so other tools cannot potentially become contaminated. Use rubber dams over a patient's mouth for procedures when possible to limit spray of secretions. Use multiple dental workers when doing aerosol-generating procedures when possible to speed up the visit and minimize exposure. Install high-efficiency particulate air filters to improve room filtration, which might, research suggests, reduce transmission of airborne particles of the virus.  Although a weekly survey by the American Dental Association of dental practices nationwide found that their volume of patients had reached 65% of pre-COVID-19 levels as of June 22, dentists know at least some patients continue to be worried enough to stay away, even if they're in pain or overdue for important procedures such as gum surgery. Delaying checkups or care for dental pain can potentially turn a small cavity into a root canal or tooth extraction and add to treatment time, higher costs and even more pain, says Howard Golan, a dentist in Williston Park, N.Y., who recently reopened his practice after seeing patients only for emergency care since mid-March. In rare cases, he says, missing out on dental care can result in serious infections and even death. Dentists have a vested interest in taking all possible precautions. ""Dentists are typically 12 to 18 inches away from their patients,"" says Louis G. DePaola, associate dean of clinical affairs at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry in Baltimore. ""To do their work dentists have to lean close in to what currently is the most infectious part of a person if they have COVID-19 — their mouth."" Protecting the health of others working in the office is paramount, too. What about the orthodontist? Daniella Smith of Silver Spring, Md., saw her dentist for a cleaning in late May, and that's when she also resumed orthodontist visits for her two children, ages 12 and 15. ""I was pretty impressed by all the new measures,"" says Smith, including staff opening all doors and not using the high-powered polisher during her cleaning. The kids were advised to brush their teeth just before coming to the office, to cut down on saliva being sprayed during an appointment.  Shots - Health News Infection Outbreak Shines Light On Water Risks At Dentist Offices""With all the time and money spent on the kids' braces, we really didn't want their teeth to move back,"" Smith says, ""which is why we made appointments when the office opened back up."" Ideally, dentists would test their patients for the coronavirus ahead of their appointments and reschedule anyone who tested positive. But the ""point of care"" tests that can give results in about 15 minutes can produce false results, says Marko Vujicic, chief economist and vice president at the American Dental Association's Health Policy Institute. ""We're keeping our eyes on testing to see if there will be an effective way we can truly determine the COVID status of patients before treatment,"" Vujicic says. ""Until then, we are advising dentists to take an abundance of caution according to the guidelines when it comes to treating patients."" ""I think everyone is looking for the best science as we go forward,"" says Connie White, president of the Academy of General Dentistry and interim dean for clinical programs at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Dentistry. The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research is soliciting coronavirus-related research proposals on, among other things, ways to improve disinfection and prevent disease transmission.  Meanwhile, White and other dental leaders also say they realize continued upticks in coronavirus cases across the U.S. could result in dental offices being told to shut again in certain regions. ""I hope that's not the case, of course,"" White says. But with openings and closures in flux, it's a good idea to make sure any dental procedure begun during one appointment can be concluded soon thereafter. ""Patients should discuss with their dentist what is necessary to do right now and what can wait,"" White advises. Remember, infectious disease specialists note, that we all have important responsibilities as patients, too, to let the dentist know before or on the day of the appointment if we're feeling sick in any way. We're all in this together — if you're sick, stay home."

Although a weekly survey by the American Dental Association of dental practices nationwide found that their volume of patients had reached 65% of pre-COVID-19 levels as of June 22, dentists know at least some patients continue to be worried enough to stay away, even if they're in pain or overdue for important procedures such as gum surgery. Delaying checkups or care for dental pain can potentially turn a small cavity into a root canal or tooth extraction and add to treatment time, higher costs and even more pain, says Howard Golan, a dentist in Williston Park, N.Y., who recently reopened his practice after seeing patients only for emergency care since mid-March. In rare cases, he says, missing out on dental care can result in serious infections and even death. Dentists have a vested interest in taking all possible precautions. ""Dentists are typically 12 to 18 inches away from their patients,"" says Louis G. DePaola, associate dean of clinical affairs at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry in Baltimore. ""To do their work dentists have to lean close in to what currently is the most infectious part of a person if they have COVID-19 — their mouth."" Protecting the health of others working in the office is paramount, too. What about the orthodontist? Daniella Smith of Silver Spring, Md., saw her dentist for a cleaning in late May, and that's when she also resumed orthodontist visits for her two children, ages 12 and 15. ""I was pretty impressed by all the new measures,"" says Smith, including staff opening all doors and not using the high-powered polisher during her cleaning. The kids were advised to brush their teeth just before coming to the office, to cut down on saliva being sprayed during an appointment.  Shots - Health News Infection Outbreak Shines Light On Water Risks At Dentist Offices""With all the time and money spent on the kids' braces, we really didn't want their teeth to move back,"" Smith says, ""which is why we made appointments when the office opened back up."" Ideally, dentists would test their patients for the coronavirus ahead of their appointments and reschedule anyone who tested positive. But the ""point of care"" tests that can give results in about 15 minutes can produce false results, says Marko Vujicic, chief economist and vice president at the American Dental Association's Health Policy Institute. ""We're keeping our eyes on testing to see if there will be an effective way we can truly determine the COVID status of patients before treatment,"" Vujicic says. ""Until then, we are advising dentists to take an abundance of caution according to the guidelines when it comes to treating patients."" ""I think everyone is looking for the best science as we go forward,"" says Connie White, president of the Academy of General Dentistry and interim dean for clinical programs at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Dentistry. The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research is soliciting coronavirus-related research proposals on, among other things, ways to improve disinfection and prevent disease transmission.  Meanwhile, White and other dental leaders also say they realize continued upticks in coronavirus cases across the U.S. could result in dental offices being told to shut again in certain regions. ""I hope that's not the case, of course,"" White says. But with openings and closures in flux, it's a good idea to make sure any dental procedure begun during one appointment can be concluded soon thereafter. ""Patients should discuss with their dentist what is necessary to do right now and what can wait,"" White advises. Remember, infectious disease specialists note, that we all have important responsibilities as patients, too, to let the dentist know before or on the day of the appointment if we're feeling sick in any way. We're all in this together — if you're sick, stay home."

Dental offices were largely shuttered across the United States after being advised in March by the American Dental Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to close their practices to all but emergency care. Many closed entirely. The hope was that by allowing dentists to continue to treat serious cases — such as intense tooth pain and infections — those patients would stay out of hospital emergency rooms, where medical workers were busy with severely ill coronavirus patients. And because the personal protective gear dentists and other health care providers need was in short supply, routine dental checkups and cleanings were deemed nonessential at least initially.  Shots - Health News My Gym Is Reopening. Is It Safe To Work Out There? Shots - Health News Is It Safe Yet To Get Your Physical Or A Dental Checkup?More recently though, the restrictions against routine care have been loosened in many places. So, is it really safe to go to the dentist now? Can't completely eliminate the coronavirus transmission risk  Dr. Gregory Poland, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic and a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, says he thinks some infections in dental settings are likely to be inevitable. ""But the hope is that recommendations for their practices that all dentists should be following will mitigate that risk,"" Poland says. The concern about the risk of transmission of COVID-19 during a visit to the dentist is understandable. Dental settings have ""unique characteristics that warrant specific infection control considerations,"" says Michele Neuburger, a dental officer for the CDC's Division of Oral Health and a member of the CDC's COVID-19 Response Infection Prevention Control Team. ""Dental health care personnel use instruments such as dental [drills], ultrasonic scalers and air-water syringes that create a visible spray that can contain particle droplets of water, saliva, blood, microorganisms and other debris,"" Neuburger says.   Coronavirus Live Updates CDC Advice On Surface Spread Of COVID-19 'Has Not Changed,' Agency SaysLarge droplets can land directly on others in the exam room and can contaminate frequently touched surfaces. The spray could also include small ""aerosolized"" droplets of COVID-19 if a patient has the virus. And those droplets can remain in the air for up to three hours, according to some estimates, and potentially spread the virus to dental staff or the next patient unless stringent precautions — such as personal protective equipment for staff and disinfection of the treatment room, instruments and surfaces between patients — aren't taken. No cases of COVID-19 traced to dental offices so far Despite these potential risks, the good news is that both the World Health Organization and the CDC say there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 transmitted in a dental office so far. And that includes follow-up by the CDC of news reports suggesting such infections, Neuburger says. In mid-May, in sync with the American Dental Association, the CDC issued more guidance for dental practices, which continues to be periodically updated.  Shots - Health News A Good Dentist Is Hard To Find In Rural America Shots - Health News No-Drill Dentistry: Fluoride Treatments Can Prevent Cavities In AdultsRon Greenberg, 62, a computer science professor at Loyola University in Chicago, returned to his dentist in early June. ""I have been nervous about going anywhere since mid-March,"" he says. But when he finally screwed up the courage for his delayed checkup, the dental office had ""lots of procedures in place"" that made him feel better. A member of the staff called with a list of questions about his health a few days before the appointment, then again on the day of his checkup. Greenberg was told to call the receptionist from his car when he arrived and then wait to let a staffer open the office's front door — so he didn't even need to touch a doorknob. ""They led me straight to the hand sanitizer,"" he says. ""Next was a temperature check. ... Everybody wore masks until I had to take mine off for them to work on me. And the hygienist and dentist had full face shields for when they were working close in."" Greenberg says he was confident enough after experiencing all those extra precautions to schedule a follow-up appointment for several days later to repair a chipped tooth. CDC guidelines: Avoid powered tools where possible Greenberg's visit included many of the precautions recommended by the CDC. These, edited for clarity, include:  Screen patients before each appointment, and when they arrive, for symptoms of COVID-19 — such as cough and fever — and postpone if they have symptoms that could indicate they have the virus. Use each patient's car or a spot outside the office as the waiting room. Remove items such as toys, magazines and coffee stations [which can be infection sources] from waiting rooms. Require masks for patients and anyone with them while in the office area and immediately after procedures and checkups. Place a plastic or glass barrier between patient and reception staff. Avoid using powered tools when possible — some practices no longer use a polisher for teeth cleanings, for example. Leave out only the tools needed for each individual patient so other tools cannot potentially become contaminated. Use rubber dams over a patient's mouth for procedures when possible to limit spray of secretions. Use multiple dental workers when doing aerosol-generating procedures when possible to speed up the visit and minimize exposure. Install high-efficiency particulate air filters to improve room filtration, which might, research suggests, reduce transmission of airborne particles of the virus.

""I'm in the Ramble, and there's a man, African American, he's got a bicycle helmet. He's recording me and threatening me and my dog,"" she says. Christian Cooper never appears to come closer to her. After repeating herself to the emergency dispatch operator, Amy Cooper begins yelling in the phone with  more panic in her voice.  ""I'm sorry. I can't hear. Are you there? I'm being threatened by a man into the Ramble. Please send the cops immediately!"" she screams. After the woman is seen putting her dog on its leash, the video ends.

Christian Cooper told NPR in May that what she did was ""pretty crappy without a doubt."" But he said he wasn't sure the response to her actions had been proportionate.

Christian Cooper/AP                    A white woman who called the police and claimed a Black man was threatening her after he asked her to put her dog on a leash in New York's Central Park will be prosecuted over the incident, Manhattan's district attorney said Monday.  ""Today our Office initiated a prosecution of Amy Cooper for Falsely Reporting an Incident in the Third Degree,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. said in a statement.  If convicted of the Class A misdemeanor, Cooper could face up to one year in jail, a fine or both.  The woman's behavior as she called the police has been widely criticized as racist at a time when the U.S. is facing a broader conversation over its legacy of racial injustice.  The incident between her and Christian Cooper, who is Black and not related, took place in a wooded area of the park that requires dogs to be leashed at all times.  Christian Cooper, an avid bird-watcher, recorded a portion of their interaction on his cellphone. It was later posted to social media and went viral.   The dispute prompted widespread discussion about incidents in which white people have called law enforcement to report people of color, and Black people in particular, for seemingly innocuous activities.  The encounter between two took place on May 25, the same day that George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis. Floyd, a Black man, died  after a white officer knelt on his neck for several minutes.  Floyd's death was also captured on cellphone video, and the now-former officer faces a second-degree murder charge.  The Manhattan District Attorney's Office said Amy Cooper is scheduled to be arraigned on Oct. 14. It did not immediately provide further information about the case. ""I would like to encourage anyone who has been the target of false reporting to contact our Office,"" Vance said. ""We are strongly committed to holding perpetrators of this conduct accountable.""

Jason Kempin/Getty Images                    At a Safeway in Washington, D.C., this week, 19-year-old Tala Jordan was having trouble checking items off her shopping list.   Fresh meat: Nope.

And like families across America, they saw others making a rush to buy goods and figured they should stock up as well.   The Coronavirus Crisis Here's What's Been Flying Off Store ShelvesNielsen reported spikes in sales of medical supplies and nonperishable food earlier this month. And it predicted more pandemic-driven shopping as federal, state and local governments urge people to stay at home to avoid spreading the coronavirus.   Retailers assure shoppers they will stay open. Grocery stores provide a critical service to communities, and even in pandemic-struck Italy, where the entire country is under lockdown, grocery stores and pharmacies kept operating. But shortages of some high-demand items may continue for a while.   The Coronavirus Crisis Small Businesses To Washington: Please Send Money Soon Or We Won't Survive UNFI, one of the largest food distributors in the United States, says some warehouses are running at 200% to 500% their average capacity at this time of year. It's like the weekend before Thanksgiving — day after day after day.  Chris Testa, UNFI's president and chief marketing officer, says that in some cases, the suppliers just can't keep up. ""There's only so many gallons of milk that can be produced, only so many eggs that can be produced,"" he says. Even when supply exists, there can still be shortages.  The Coronavirus Crisis COVID-19 Threatens Food Supply Chain As Farms Worry About Workers Falling IllAdnan Durrani has warehouses full of product. His company, Saffron Road Foods, which makes frozen entrees, predicted this spike in demand.  Still, it takes time for a distributor to pack a truck and send it to a store. ""If they fill that store's backroom inventory, that may not be enough because that may sell out in one day or less,"" Durrani says. ""And they're used to having inventories that last a week or two.""    That can mean empty shelves, at least temporarily. But retailers and producers can meet this challenge, he says, because America has strong supply chains.  And at least for now, American food producers are not experiencing production troubles. The barren shelves are simply a reflection of the unusual increase in demand.  Testa says his company is working to recruit out-of-work warehouse workers and truckers from industries hit hard by the coronavirus to help meet the urgent need at distribution centers.  While shortages persist, retail trade groups are urging people not to buy more items than they would use in a couple of weeks — to give others a chance to meet their basic needs. In addition, grocery shopping can mean braving crowds, exactly what everyone is supposed to avoid in order to fight this pandemic. Experts recommend attempting to shop at less-popular times of day.

The Coronavirus Crisis Empty Grocery Shelves Are Alarming, But They're Not PermanentSo far, there's been some response.  Uber recently updated its sick policy to say it'll provide up to two weeks' financial assistance to drivers who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed in quarantine by public health authorities. Postmates says it's also offering to help with medical expenses for drivers who meet certain requirements.  And across apps, there seems to be a push for customers to choose the ""contactless delivery"" option that asks drivers to leave food outside doors and on front porches. ""I'm not that close to [people] when I hand off the food and go,"" says Stephanie Session as she heads inside Patria Cocina to pick up an order.  She started delivering for Uber Eats last year, but she says that since social distancing became encouraged, the volume of weekday orders is matching that of a busy weekend. And to her, more orders and better tips makes the work worth it.  It's unclear when restaurants will fully reopen. But workers like Session plan to keep delivering as long as orders keep coming in — and there may be more drivers soon.  DoorDash is rolling out a new ""priority access"" program for in-house restaurant employees who would like to start delivering during their unexpected time off.  Back at Krog Street Market, as he carefully loads food into his car, Willis summarizes the situation: ""People still gotta eat."" "

Lynne Sladky/AP                    With its ride-hailing business devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, Uber is in talks to acquire online food delivery company Grubhub. If the two sides can reach a deal, the combined company would emerge as the dominant food-delivery app with 55% of the U.S. market, according to analyst Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities. ""Clearly this would be an aggressive move by Uber to take out a major competitor on the Uber Eats front and further consolidate its market share position, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to shift more of a focus to deliveries versus ride-sharing in the near term,"" Ives wrote in a note to investors. With so many people unwilling or unable to go out to restaurants because of the coronavirus pandemic, demand for food delivery has surged. Competition among the various apps, including DoorDash and Postmates, has intensified.  The Coronavirus Crisis As Restaurants Across The Country Close Their Doors, Deliveries Pick UpDespite a spike in orders, none of the top food-delivery apps are turning a profit. That has caused discussion about mergers to swirl for some time. The pandemic has sped up those deliberations, says analyst Tom White with D.A. Davidson. ""We've long believed that consolidation in online food delivery is inevitable,"" he wrote in an email to NPR. White predicts food-delivery apps will remain popular even after the economy gets moving again. In March — the most recent month for which data is available — DoorDash was the most popular meal-delivery service, with some 42% of all U.S. sales in the category, according to analytics firm Second Measure. It was trailed by Grubhub with 28% and Uber Eats with 20%.  Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told investors during an earnings call last week that as its ride-hailing business has nose-dived, enlisting drivers to deliver food to doorsteps may become a larger part of the company's future.  Business Delivery Only: The Rise Of Restaurants With No Diners As Apps Take Orders""The big opportunity we thought Eats was just got bigger,"" Khosrowshahi said. He argued that a merged food-delivery company could be a boon for both restaurants and diners. ""There is a bunch of consolidation happening on a global basis where bigger players can not only provide better service for restaurants and consumers, but can provide a better service kind of on an economic basis that is sustainable,"" Khosrowshahi said. But the merger chatter comes as cities across the country are cracking down on food-delivery apps by capping the fees they can charge per order. Some restaurant owners say the fees, which can range from 10% to 40% of the total bill, hurt their bottom lines at a time when the industry is struggling to survive. Companies like Grubhub counter that they are widening restaurants' customer bases and that the higher-end fees reflect the additional marketing services that they provide to restaurant owners who choose it. Food delivery apps also contend it would be more costly for restaurants to develop their own technology and pay for their own drivers to deliver meals.  Coronavirus Live Updates Uber Cuts Thousands of Jobs, Citing Coronavirus PandemicA deal between Uber and Grubhub may run into problems with federal regulators. Analyst White said antitrust regulators may inspect the potential merger closely given the impact it could have on the restaurant sector at a time of deep peril for the industry. U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who chairs the House's antitrust subcommittee, has come out in opposition of a deal. In a statement, he characterized the potential merger in starkly critical terms. ""Uber is a notoriously predatory company that has long denied its drivers a living wage,"" Cicilline said. ""Its attempt to acquire Grubhub — which has a history of exploiting local restaurants through deceptive tactics and extortionate fees — marks a new low in pandemic profiteering."""

Mark Lennihan/AP                    For an idea of why independent restaurants have long complained about food delivery apps, just ask Anil Bathwal, who owns The Kati Roll Company, a group of New York City restaurants serving Indian street food.  Bathwal relied on a handful of food apps to supplement his dining-in purchases, despite hefty commissions the apps tack on to every sale; he used Grubhub-owned Seamless, Uber Eats, Postmates and other food-ferrying services.  If someone ordered two kati rolls for about $12, the apps took a hefty chunk of that sale: roughly a 17% commission on top of a fee for delivering the food to someone's door. In the end, Bathwal said, that kati roll purchased on the delivery app would net his restaurant about $7. App commissions were more manageable when it represented a smaller segment of overall revenue. But the pandemic changed that.  ""That's the only game right now. There's no other way for people to get business because of the lockdown,"" Bathwal says. ""If it starts becoming 30%, 40%, 50% of your business, it is not incremental business — it is your business.""  With already thin profit margins further diluted by the app fees, Bathwal could not justify keeping his six locations open. He temporarily shuttered all of his restaurants with hopes of reopening, when he can, on a pared-down menu emphasizing items that are the most affordable to make.   The Coronavirus Crisis Uber Woos Grubhub, In A Move Lawmaker Calls 'Pandemic Profiteering' He expects food delivery apps to represent a sizable portion of his sales when he can restart his business, but he is not yet sure whether he will be able to make the numbers work out. In a bid to help struggling restaurants, cities from Seattle to Washington, D.C., are passing caps restricting how much food apps can charge to deliver meals. The food delivery apps have different ways of devising fees, but they tend to be in the range of 20% to 40% of how much a restaurant makes in app-generated revenue.  On Wednesday, New York became the latest city to pass commission limits: third-party delivery services will not be able to charge more than 15% per order, and the tech companies cannot add more than 5% for other fees, like credit card processing and for better placement on the apps.  Councilman Mark Gjonaj, who sponsored the bill, said the food delivery apps have placed some restaurants on life support, but it is not sustainable.  ""Without them, it's an instant death. With them, it's a slow death,"" Gjonaj said in an interview.  Grubhub, which controls two-thirds of New York City's food delivery market, claims the commission ceiling could have an unintended consequence for restaurants.  The Salt Uber's Online-Only Restaurants: The Future, Or The End Of Dining Out?New York's fee cap was passed as an emergency measure and applies for as long as restaurants remain closed and for 90 days after eateries are able to reopen.  ""Any arbitrary cap — regardless of the duration — will lower order volume to locally-owned restaurants, increase costs for small business owners, and raise costs on customers,"" Grubhub spokesman John Collins said in a statement. ""Delivery workers would have fewer work opportunities and lower earnings. We also believe that any cap on fees represents an overstep by local officials and will not withstand a legal challenge."" A spokesperson for Postmates said in a statement that limiting commissions makes it harder to operate and ""kills the whole industry's ability to provide the services restaurants need to stay open during this national emergency."" Lawyer Gregory Frank is skeptical about this reasoning. Frank filed a federal lawsuit in Manhattan last month seeking class-action status accusing Grubhub, Doordash, Postmates and Uber Eats of ripping off both customers and restaurants.  Frank points to a clause in the contracts restaurants and the food delivery apps agree to that prohibits owners from charging delivery customers more than people who dine in, even though delivery costs more.  The Coronavirus Crisis As Restaurants Across The Country Close Their Doors, Deliveries Pick Up""By not forcing those purchasing on apps to bear the whole amount of the fees, instead forcing all menu prices to rise together, in-restaurant diners are effectively subsidizing Grubhub's high rates,"" said Frank, who argues such an arrangement is anti-competitive and illegal. Grubhub and the other food delivery apps have not yet filed legal responses to the complaint. Despite the commissions, PitchBook analyst Asad Hussain notes that none of the major food delivery apps are turning a profit.  ""Capping these fees will present a headwind for these companies. It's going to have an impact on growth, and ultimately some of these costs are going to be passed on to consumers, and that's going to reduce demand for these services,"" said Hussain, who expects the coronavirus to hasten consolidation among the delivery apps.   Business Delivery Only: The Rise Of Restaurants With No Diners As Apps Take OrdersWith or without the food delivery apps, some restaurants that have had revenue wiped out will never come back after the pandemic.  A survey from the National Restaurant Association found that the pandemic has caused 4 in 10 eateries to close, and some will never be able to open again. Bathwal with The Kati Roll Company said one of his top tasks ahead of any reopening is trying to negotiate with his landlords.  ""Landlords have been understanding. Some of them are deferring. Some are giving us a little bit of a rent abatement,"" he says. ""So we're hopeful, but we really don't know what's going to happen."""

The book was originally set for release on July 28, but will now arrive on July 14.The revised date, announced Monday, came after a New York appellate court cleared the way for the books publication following a legal challenge by Trumps brother.The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the release date change.Robert Trump had sued Mary Trump to block publication of a book promoted to contain an insiders perspective of countless holiday meals, family interactions and family events.A judge last week left in place a restraint that blocked Mary Trump and any agent of hers from distributing the book, but the court made clear it was not considering Simon & Schuster to be covered by the ruling. The publisher has said that 75,000 first-run editions had already been sent to bookstores.Mary Trump is the daughter of Fred Trump Jr., the presidents elder brother, who died in 1981. She has a doctorate in psychology.Mary L. Trump has the education, insight, and intimate familiarity needed to reveal what makes Donald, and the rest of her clan, tick, a release about the book said.The book is expected to include a number of allegations about President Trump, including how his upbringing led to his worldview and the derision he showed his father after he was diagnosed with Alzheimers disease.The books back cover opens with a biting critique of the president: Today, Donald is much as he was at three years old: incapable of growing, learning, or evolving, unable to regulate his emotions, moderate his responses, or take in and synthesize information."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/uber-buys-postmates-in-2-65-billion-deal,Uber buys Postmates in $2.65 billion deal,Matt Ott,"['Jul 6, 2020']","SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) — Uber has widened its reach in the fiercely competitive delivery market by acquiring Postmates in a $2.65 billion all-stock deal, the company said Monday.The acquisition enables the ride-hailing giant to increase its delivery offerings at a time when the global pandemic has suppressed customers desire for rides while boosting home delivery needs. While Ubers meal delivery business, Uber Eats, has mostly focused on restaurants, Postmates delivers a wider array of goods including groceries, pharmacy items, alcoholic drinks and party supplies.The vision for us is to become an everyday service, said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, in a conference call with investors Monday. Postmates is a great step along that vision. Anyplace you want to go, anything you want delivered to your home, Uber is going to be there with you, and we think these everyday frequent interactions create a habit, create a connection with customers.WATCH: With food-delivery apps like Uber Eats, whos actually making money?Uber and its Uber Eats food-delivery division will gain ground against DoorDash, which controls about 44% of the U.S. meal delivery market. Thats compared with Uber Eats 23% share before the Postmates deal. Grubhub and its subsidiaries had just under 23% of the U.S. meal delivery market, according to May figures from Second Measure, a data analysis company. Postmates had about 8% of the market.We really believe that the market is much bigger than, lets say, the traditional delivery players, Khosrowshahi said. We look at groceries as a category, theres a lot of hot food being delivered, we look at essentials as a category that we are going to go after as well.Last month, Uber lost out in a bid for Grubhub, which would have made it the dominant U.S. food delivery service. But Amsterdam-based Just Eat Takeaway.com ended up nabbing Chicagos Grubhub in a $7.3 billion deal. Uber was reportedly seeking to team Grubhub with its Uber Eats business.The food delivery sector is undergoing a major consolidation this year and more is expected. The number of people using food delivery services is on the rise because of the coronavirus pandemic, but customers tend to jump around from service to service depending on where they can find the best deal.Some restaurants are already leaving the platforms, saying the commissions — which can top 30% — are too high.The Panda Express chain launched its own delivery service last month, saying delivery companies were making its meals too expensive for consumers. In March, some Washington restaurant and bar owners banded together to start their own delivery service, DC To-GoGo. It currently offers delivery from 18 establishments, and founder Josh Saltzman said its adding more each week.Smaller restaurants, however, lack the muscle to negotiate favorable terms with the third-party platforms, or the capacity to build out their own online ordering service. Many are turning to delivery, despite the costs, as a means surviving pandemic shutdown orders.For restaurants, the deal is not quite as good, said Stephen Beck, managing partner of management consultancy cg42. A consolidation of power, so to speak, and fewer options is not a good thing for the restaurant industry.Third-party delivery orders in the U.S. have risen from 2% of restaurant transactions to about 7% during the pandemic, according to David Portalatin, food industry advisor at the NPD Group. In the month of May, third-party delivery orders rose 170% compared to the previous year, he said.Its a very challenging business to start with and for that reason, you had a lot of independent restaurants who said third-party delivery is not for us. Then, the world changed dramatically overnight, Portalatin said. There has been a dramatic shift, so everybody is participating. That is going to enable the third-party apps to sign up a whole lot of restaurants.WATCH: Uber whistleblower Susan Fowler details harassment, retaliation in new bookFor many restaurants, the price of partnering with third-party platforms is coming on top of the costs of reopening with reduced capacity and other safety restrictions imposed because of the virus, Portalatin said.Unfortunately, some restaurants are going to close, and some are going to evolve, he said.Uber has leaned on its food delivery business with COVID-19 cutting into all ride-share businesses. Ubers rides business slid 3% in the first quarter and dropped 80% in April compared with the same time last year. Bookings through its food delivery business, on the other hand, surged 54% in the first quarter.By acquiring Postmates, Uber not only gets the bigger share of the food delivery market it has long desired, but also shores itself up against further pandemic-related losses in its ride-hailing division.In our opinion, Uber finds itself with its back against the wall on the consolidation theme as the Grubhub deal fell apart on anti-trust concerns, and now must quickly look to acquire market share and added scale which makes the Postmates deal a smart strategic fit, analysts with Wedbush Securities wrote Monday.Postmates, a closely held private company, claims 600,000 food and restaurant merchants to choose from, which it claims is the largest selection in the U.S. The company says it has the ability to serve 80% of households across all 50 states.The boards of both companies have approved the transaction and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.Uber and Postmates are both based in San Francisco.Shares of Uber Technologies Inc. rose $1.84, or 6%, to close Monday at $32.52.AP Business Writers Alexandra Olson in New York and Dee-Ann Durbin in Ann Arbor, Michigan, contributed to this story."

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/judge-orders-dakota-access-pipeline-shut-down-pending-environmental-review,Judge orders Dakota Access pipeline shut down pending environmental review,Dave Kolpack,"['Jul 6, 2020']","FARGO, N.D. (AP) — A judge on Monday ordered the Dakota Access pipeline shut down for additional environmental review more than three years after it began pumping oil — handing a victory to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and delivering a blow to President Donald Trumps efforts to weaken public health and environmental protections it views as obstacles to businesses.In a 24-page order, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., wrote that he was mindful of the disruption that shutting down the pipeline would cause, but that it must be done within 30 days. Pipeline owner Energy Transfer plans to ask a court to halt the order and will seek an expedited appeal, spokeswoman Vicki Granado said.The order comes after Boesberg said in April that a more extensive review was necessary than what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers already conducted and that he would consider whether the pipeline should be shuttered during the new assessment.The Court does not reach its decision with blithe disregard for the lives it will affect, Boasberg wrote Monday.Yet, given the seriousness of the Corps NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) error, the impossibility of a simple fix, the fact that Dakota Access did assume much of its economic risk knowingly, and the potential harm each day the pipeline operates, the Court is forced to conclude that the flow of oil must cease, he added.The findings may challenge the legal footing for the Trump administrations most momentous environmental rollbacks. Trump surrounded himself with industry leaders and workers in hard hats this January when he announced plans to overhaul the rules for enforcing NEPA.The Dakota Access pipeline was the subject of months of protests in 2016 and 2017, sometimes violent, during its construction near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border. The tribe pressed litigation against the pipeline even after it began carrying oil from North Dakota across South Dakota and Iowa and to a shipping point in Illinois in June 2017.The $3.8 billion, 1,172-mile (1,886 kilometer) pipeline crosses beneath the Missouri River, just north of the reservation. The tribe draws its water from the river and fears pollution.This pipeline should have never been built here. We told them that from the beginning, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Mike Faith said in a statement.Texas-based Energy Transfer contends proper procedures were followed in granting the original easement for the pipeline, Granado said.The economic implications of the Judges order are too big to ignore and we will do all we can to ensure its continued operation, she said. Billions of dollars in tax and royalty revenue will be lost by state, local and tribal governments in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Farmers will suffer as crude transportation will move to rail, displacing corn, wheat and soy crops that would normally be moved to market. Ironically, the counties along these rail lines will face increased environmental risks due to the increased amount of crude oil traveling by rail.Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, decried what he called a shocking ruling and noted that the pipeline is moving 570,000 barrels of Bakken oil a day.Before the coronavirus pandemic devastated the U.S. oil industry, daily oil production in North Dakota — the nations No. 2 oil producer behind Texas — was at a near-record 1.45 million barrels daily. The states output slipped to below 1 million barrels daily in May amid low energy prices and sparse demand.Permits for the project were originally rejected by the Obama administration, and the Army Corps of Engineers prepared to conduct a full environmental review. In February 2017, after Trump took office, the Corps scrapped the review and granted permits, concluding that running the pipeline under the Missouri River posed no significant environmental issues.The Corps said that opinion was validated after an additional year of review, as ordered by Boasberg, an Obama appointee, in 2017.Boasberg ruled then that the Corps largely complied with environmental law when permitting the pipeline but ordered more review because he said the agency did not adequately consider how an oil spill under the Missouri River might affect the Standing Rock Siouxs fishing and hunting rights, or whether it might disproportionately affect the tribal community.Associated Press writers James MacPherson in Bismarck, N.D., and Ellen Knickmeyer in Oklahoma City contributed to this story."

On the video he recorded of the woman, he sounds calm and appears to keep a safe distance from her.District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement on Monday that his office had charged Amy Cooper with falsely reporting the confrontation, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of a year behind bars. She was ordered to appear in court on Oct. 14.Coopers attorney, Robert Barnes, said Cooper would fight the charge. His client, he said, has already lost her livelihood and her public life. Now some demand her freedom?Reached by phone on Monday, Christian Cooper said he had no reaction or comment.After the backlash, Amy Cooper released an apology through a public relations service, saying she reacted emotionally and made false assumptions about his intentions.WATCH: Reasons for hope amid Americas racial unrestHe had every right to request that I leash my dog in an area where it was required, she said in the written statement. I am well aware of the pain that misassumptions and insensitive statements about race cause and would never have imagined that I would be involved in the type of incident that occurred with Chris.Amy Coopers 911 call was seen by many as a stark example of everyday racism and fueled outrage in the period leading up to the street protests sparked by the police custody death of George Floyd. It also inspired New York state lawmakers in June to pass a law that makes it easier under civil rights law to sue an individual who calls a police officer on someone without reason because of their background, including race and national origin.The new law, which the governor also signed last month, holds an individual who makes such 911 calls liable for injunctive relief, damages, or any other appropriate relief in a civil lawsuit. Cooper was charged under an existing false-report law thats been long on the books and doesnt reference race.The confrontation began early one morning when Christian Cooper said he noticed Amy Cooper had let her cocker spaniel off its leash against the rules in the Ramble, a secluded section of Central Park popular with birdwatchers.In the video posted on social media, he claimed the dog was tearing through the plantings and told her she should go to another part of the park. When she refused, he pulled out dog treats, causing her to scream at him to not come near her dog.Amy Cooper also warned him she would summon police unless he stopped recording.Im going to tell them theres an African American man threatening my life, Amy Cooper is heard saying in the video as she pulls down her face mask and struggles to control her dog.Please call the cops, Christian Cooper says.Theres an African American man, Im in Central Park, he is recording me and threatening myself and my dog. … Please send the cops immediately! she says during the call before he stops recording.Police say by the time they responded, they were both gone.___Associated Press writer Michael R.

The Redskins decision came after FedEx, which paid $205 million for naming rights to the teams stadium, and other corporate partners called for the team to change its nickname.Hours later, the Indians Major League Baseball team announced that they, too, will review their long-debated name.We are committed to making a positive impact in our community and embrace our responsibility to advance social justice and equality, the team said in a statement.On Sunday, Indians manager Terry Francona said he approved of the teams decision, saying it was time to move forward.Cleveland All-Star shortstop Francisco Lindor is also in favor of the Indians changing their nickname, which theyve had since 1915.If changing the name brings more love and more peace to society, Im open to listening to the change of names, Lindor said Monday. I know society is shifting and we are due for some change. So along those guidelines, yeah, Im open for a change in name if its going to bring love and happiness and more peace to the world.Trump has spent the last few days stoking divisions and exploiting racial tensions, accusing protesters who have pushed for racial justice of engaging in a merciless campaign to wipe out our history.

But she said she changed her stance because the situation in Melbourne was unprecedented and indicated the pandemic was in a new phase.The overwhelming majority of new infections detected in Melbourne in recent weeks were from community transmission.

Its a new part of the pandemic and, as such, it requires a new type of response.The Victorian government locked down 36 of the most virus-prone Melbourne suburbs last week and at the weekend added another four suburbs because of the disease spread.Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said of the 127 new cases recorded overnight, 53 were among 3,000 people who have been confined by police to their apartments in nine public housing blocks since Saturday.Australias Acting Chief Medical Officer Paulk Kelly has described the high-rises as vertical cruise ships because of the high risk of virus spread.Police allege a 32-year-old man bit a police officer on Monday as he attempted to leave a high-rise in the suburb of Flemington. He would be charged with assault, resisting police and attempting to breach a pandemic order, Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said.The infections announced Monday surpassed the first surge of infections in Melbourne that peaked on March 28 at 111 cases recorded in a day.MORE: How doctors are innovating to treat COVID-19Daniels said he agreed with Berejiklian and Prime Minister Scott Morrison, a Sydney resident, that the border needed to close. Three in five Australian residents live in Sydney or Melbourne and the air services between the two cities before the pandemic were among the busiest in the world.I think it is the smart call, the right call at this time, given the significant challenges we face in containing this virus, Andrews said.Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd confirmed that federal authorities agreed with the closure. The federal government had previously opposed any internal border closures aimed mostly at stopping spread from Victoria and New South Wales. Morrison had urged state leaders to open their borders for the good of the economy.Kidd said that only 16% of new cases detected in Australia in the past week had been infected overseas. Two weeks ago, 50% of new cases were people infected overseas and detected in hotel quarantine, he said.The situation in Melbourne has come as a jolt, not just of the people of Melbourne but people right across Australia who may have thought that this was all behind us. It is not, Kidd said.Outside of Victoria, another 13 cases reported in the past 24 hours were people infected overseas. Of those, 10 had been in hotel quarantine in New South Wales and three in Western AustraliaNew South Wales police will enforce the Victorian border closure. Some flights and trains services would continue for travelers who are given permits and exemptions, Berejiklian said.New South Wales Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said officers would use drones to detect people who attempt across the border via forest tracks to avoid the 55 policed road and bridge crossings.Nationwide, Australia has recorded more than 8,500 total infections and 106 deaths.McGuirk contributed to this report from Canberra Australia."

Police may also apply for a warrant that requires a person suspected of violating the national security law to surrender their travel documents, thus restricting them from leaving Hong Kong.Additionally, under the rules, written notices or restraining orders may be issued to freeze or confiscate property if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is related to an offense endangering national security.WATCH: Why this pro-democracy Hong Kong activist decided to flee his homePlatforms and publishers, as well as internet service providers, may also be ordered to take down electronic messages published that are likely to constitute an offence endangering national security or is likely to cause the occurrence of an offence endangering national security.Service providers who do not comply with such requests could face fines of up to 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,903) and receive jail terms of six months.Individuals who post such messages may also be asked to remove the message, or face similar fines and a jail term of one year.Before the release of the implementation rules on Monday, Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram said that they would deny law enforcement requests for user data in Hong Kong as they assess the effect of the national security law.The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new implementation rules.Under the implementation rules, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam may also authorize police to intercept communications and conduct surveillance to prevent and detect offences endangering national security.Finally, written notices may also be served to a foreign political organisation or Taiwan political organisation, or individual agents, to furnish details on their activities related to Hong Kong. This includes details such as personal particulars, assets, income, and expenditure of the organization in Hong Kong. Failure to comply or providing false or incomplete information can result in a fine of 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,903) or imprisonment of six months or two years respectively.The details of the implementation rules come into effect Tuesday and details were released after the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, chaired by Lam, convened its first meeting on Monday.Hong Kongs national security law, imposed last week following anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, makes secessionist, subversive, and terrorist activities illegal, as well as foreign intervention in the citys internal affairs. Any activities such as shouting slogans or holding up banners and flags calling for the citys independence are a violation of the law regardless of whether violence is used. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment.Critics see it as Beijings boldest step yet to erase the legal firewall between the former British colony and the mainlands authoritarian Communist Party system.Hanscom Smith, U.S. consul general to Hong Kong and Macau, said Monday that it is a tragedy to use the semi-autonomous Chinese territorys new national security law to chip away at freedoms in the Asian financial hub.Using the national security law to erode fundamental freedoms and to create an atmosphere of coercion and self-censorship is a tragedy for Hong Kong, Smith told reporters. Hong Kong has been successful precisely because of its openness and well do everything we can to maintain that.Since the law went into effect, the government has specified that the popular protest slogan Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time has separatist connotations and is thus criminalized.In Hong Kongs public libraries, books by pro-democracy figures have been pulled from the shelves, including those written by prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong and politician Tanya Chan. The authority that runs the libraries said it is reviewing the books in light of the new legislation.Many pro-democracy shops that publicly stood in solidarity with protesters have removed pro-democracy notes and artwork that adorned the walls of their stores, fearful that they might violate the new law.A 23-year-old man, Tong Ying-kit, was the first person in Hong Kong to be charged under the new law, for allegedly driving a motorcycle into a group of policemen while bearing a flag with the Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time slogan.Tong appeared in court Monday facing charges of incitement to secession and terrorist activities. He was denied bail.Separately, pro-democracy activists Agnes Chow, Joshua Wong and Ivan Lam also appeared in court Monday over charges related to a protest last June. Chow pleaded guilty to inciting others to participate in an unlawful assembly, as well as to participating in an unauthorized assembly.News Wrap: Controversial Hong Kong security bill becomes lawWong, who was indicted on similar charges, pleaded not guilty. Lam, who was charged with inciting others to participate in an unlawful assembly, also pleaded not guilty. All three were released on bail.With the risk of our personal safety, with the threat of life sentencing, we might be worried, and also being targeted by Beijing, but we also encourage the global community to let our voice be heard in the world, Wong told reporters Monday. We still hope to let the world know that now is the time to stand with Hong Kong, and now is the time for Hong Kongers to keep our momentum.The cases will move to trial and sentencing following a pretrial review for Wong and Lam scheduled for Aug. 5.A group of about 10 protesters gathered at a shopping mall in Hong Kongs Central business district on Monday holding up signs calling for city leader Carrie Lam to step down, as well as reiterating protesters demands from the pro-democracy movement last year. The demands include an independent inquiry into the police and greater democracy.Others held up blank pieces of paper as a sign of protest against the suppression of political protest in the city. About 20 riot police later entered the mall, detaining protesters holding up signs, although they did not appear to make any arrests.We feel worried that we may be convicted for expressing our views, said protester Anthea Wong. Thats why we are using white paper instead.Associated Press journalist Katie Tam contributed to this report."

The book was originally set for release on July 28, but will now arrive on July 14.The revised date, announced Monday, came after a New York appellate court cleared the way for the books publication following a legal challenge by Trumps brother.The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the release date change.Robert Trump had sued Mary Trump to block publication of a book promoted to contain an insiders perspective of countless holiday meals, family interactions and family events.A judge last week left in place a restraint that blocked Mary Trump and any agent of hers from distributing the book, but the court made clear it was not considering Simon & Schuster to be covered by the ruling. The publisher has said that 75,000 first-run editions had already been sent to bookstores.Mary Trump is the daughter of Fred Trump Jr., the presidents elder brother, who died in 1981. She has a doctorate in psychology.Mary L. Trump has the education, insight, and intimate familiarity needed to reveal what makes Donald, and the rest of her clan, tick, a release about the book said.The book is expected to include a number of allegations about President Trump, including how his upbringing led to his worldview and the derision he showed his father after he was diagnosed with Alzheimers disease.The books back cover opens with a biting critique of the president: Today, Donald is much as he was at three years old: incapable of growing, learning, or evolving, unable to regulate his emotions, moderate his responses, or take in and synthesize information."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/uber-buys-postmates-in-2-65-billion-deal,Uber buys Postmates in $2.65 billion deal,Matt Ott,"['Jul 6, 2020']","SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) — Uber has widened its reach in the fiercely competitive delivery market by acquiring Postmates in a $2.65 billion all-stock deal, the company said Monday.The acquisition enables the ride-hailing giant to increase its delivery offerings at a time when the global pandemic has suppressed customers desire for rides while boosting home delivery needs. While Ubers meal delivery business, Uber Eats, has mostly focused on restaurants, Postmates delivers a wider array of goods including groceries, pharmacy items, alcoholic drinks and party supplies.The vision for us is to become an everyday service, said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, in a conference call with investors Monday. Postmates is a great step along that vision. Anyplace you want to go, anything you want delivered to your home, Uber is going to be there with you, and we think these everyday frequent interactions create a habit, create a connection with customers.WATCH: With food-delivery apps like Uber Eats, whos actually making money?Uber and its Uber Eats food-delivery division will gain ground against DoorDash, which controls about 44% of the U.S. meal delivery market. Thats compared with Uber Eats 23% share before the Postmates deal. Grubhub and its subsidiaries had just under 23% of the U.S. meal delivery market, according to May figures from Second Measure, a data analysis company. Postmates had about 8% of the market.We really believe that the market is much bigger than, lets say, the traditional delivery players, Khosrowshahi said. We look at groceries as a category, theres a lot of hot food being delivered, we look at essentials as a category that we are going to go after as well.Last month, Uber lost out in a bid for Grubhub, which would have made it the dominant U.S. food delivery service. But Amsterdam-based Just Eat Takeaway.com ended up nabbing Chicagos Grubhub in a $7.3 billion deal. Uber was reportedly seeking to team Grubhub with its Uber Eats business.The food delivery sector is undergoing a major consolidation this year and more is expected. The number of people using food delivery services is on the rise because of the coronavirus pandemic, but customers tend to jump around from service to service depending on where they can find the best deal.Some restaurants are already leaving the platforms, saying the commissions — which can top 30% — are too high.The Panda Express chain launched its own delivery service last month, saying delivery companies were making its meals too expensive for consumers. In March, some Washington restaurant and bar owners banded together to start their own delivery service, DC To-GoGo. It currently offers delivery from 18 establishments, and founder Josh Saltzman said its adding more each week.Smaller restaurants, however, lack the muscle to negotiate favorable terms with the third-party platforms, or the capacity to build out their own online ordering service. Many are turning to delivery, despite the costs, as a means surviving pandemic shutdown orders.For restaurants, the deal is not quite as good, said Stephen Beck, managing partner of management consultancy cg42. A consolidation of power, so to speak, and fewer options is not a good thing for the restaurant industry.Third-party delivery orders in the U.S. have risen from 2% of restaurant transactions to about 7% during the pandemic, according to David Portalatin, food industry advisor at the NPD Group. In the month of May, third-party delivery orders rose 170% compared to the previous year, he said.Its a very challenging business to start with and for that reason, you had a lot of independent restaurants who said third-party delivery is not for us. Then, the world changed dramatically overnight, Portalatin said. There has been a dramatic shift, so everybody is participating. That is going to enable the third-party apps to sign up a whole lot of restaurants.WATCH: Uber whistleblower Susan Fowler details harassment, retaliation in new bookFor many restaurants, the price of partnering with third-party platforms is coming on top of the costs of reopening with reduced capacity and other safety restrictions imposed because of the virus, Portalatin said.Unfortunately, some restaurants are going to close, and some are going to evolve, he said.Uber has leaned on its food delivery business with COVID-19 cutting into all ride-share businesses. Ubers rides business slid 3% in the first quarter and dropped 80% in April compared with the same time last year. Bookings through its food delivery business, on the other hand, surged 54% in the first quarter.By acquiring Postmates, Uber not only gets the bigger share of the food delivery market it has long desired, but also shores itself up against further pandemic-related losses in its ride-hailing division.In our opinion, Uber finds itself with its back against the wall on the consolidation theme as the Grubhub deal fell apart on anti-trust concerns, and now must quickly look to acquire market share and added scale which makes the Postmates deal a smart strategic fit, analysts with Wedbush Securities wrote Monday.Postmates, a closely held private company, claims 600,000 food and restaurant merchants to choose from, which it claims is the largest selection in the U.S. The company says it has the ability to serve 80% of households across all 50 states.The boards of both companies have approved the transaction and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.Uber and Postmates are both based in San Francisco.Shares of Uber Technologies Inc. rose $1.84, or 6%, to close Monday at $32.52.AP Business Writers Alexandra Olson in New York and Dee-Ann Durbin in Ann Arbor, Michigan, contributed to this story."

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/judge-orders-dakota-access-pipeline-shut-down-pending-environmental-review,Judge orders Dakota Access pipeline shut down pending environmental review,Dave Kolpack,"['Jul 6, 2020']","FARGO, N.D. (AP) — A judge on Monday ordered the Dakota Access pipeline shut down for additional environmental review more than three years after it began pumping oil — handing a victory to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and delivering a blow to President Donald Trumps efforts to weaken public health and environmental protections it views as obstacles to businesses.In a 24-page order, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., wrote that he was mindful of the disruption that shutting down the pipeline would cause, but that it must be done within 30 days. Pipeline owner Energy Transfer plans to ask a court to halt the order and will seek an expedited appeal, spokeswoman Vicki Granado said.The order comes after Boesberg said in April that a more extensive review was necessary than what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers already conducted and that he would consider whether the pipeline should be shuttered during the new assessment.The Court does not reach its decision with blithe disregard for the lives it will affect, Boasberg wrote Monday.Yet, given the seriousness of the Corps NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) error, the impossibility of a simple fix, the fact that Dakota Access did assume much of its economic risk knowingly, and the potential harm each day the pipeline operates, the Court is forced to conclude that the flow of oil must cease, he added.The findings may challenge the legal footing for the Trump administrations most momentous environmental rollbacks. Trump surrounded himself with industry leaders and workers in hard hats this January when he announced plans to overhaul the rules for enforcing NEPA.The Dakota Access pipeline was the subject of months of protests in 2016 and 2017, sometimes violent, during its construction near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border. The tribe pressed litigation against the pipeline even after it began carrying oil from North Dakota across South Dakota and Iowa and to a shipping point in Illinois in June 2017.The $3.8 billion, 1,172-mile (1,886 kilometer) pipeline crosses beneath the Missouri River, just north of the reservation. The tribe draws its water from the river and fears pollution.This pipeline should have never been built here. We told them that from the beginning, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Mike Faith said in a statement.Texas-based Energy Transfer contends proper procedures were followed in granting the original easement for the pipeline, Granado said.The economic implications of the Judges order are too big to ignore and we will do all we can to ensure its continued operation, she said. Billions of dollars in tax and royalty revenue will be lost by state, local and tribal governments in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Farmers will suffer as crude transportation will move to rail, displacing corn, wheat and soy crops that would normally be moved to market. Ironically, the counties along these rail lines will face increased environmental risks due to the increased amount of crude oil traveling by rail.Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, decried what he called a shocking ruling and noted that the pipeline is moving 570,000 barrels of Bakken oil a day.Before the coronavirus pandemic devastated the U.S. oil industry, daily oil production in North Dakota — the nations No. 2 oil producer behind Texas — was at a near-record 1.45 million barrels daily. The states output slipped to below 1 million barrels daily in May amid low energy prices and sparse demand.Permits for the project were originally rejected by the Obama administration, and the Army Corps of Engineers prepared to conduct a full environmental review. In February 2017, after Trump took office, the Corps scrapped the review and granted permits, concluding that running the pipeline under the Missouri River posed no significant environmental issues.The Corps said that opinion was validated after an additional year of review, as ordered by Boasberg, an Obama appointee, in 2017.Boasberg ruled then that the Corps largely complied with environmental law when permitting the pipeline but ordered more review because he said the agency did not adequately consider how an oil spill under the Missouri River might affect the Standing Rock Siouxs fishing and hunting rights, or whether it might disproportionately affect the tribal community.Associated Press writers James MacPherson in Bismarck, N.D., and Ellen Knickmeyer in Oklahoma City contributed to this story."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/scotus-rules-presidential-electors-must-back-their-states-popular-vote-winner,SCOTUS rules presidential electors must back their states popular vote winner,Associated Press,"['Jul 6, 2020']","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that states can require presidential electors to back their states popular vote winner in the Electoral College.The ruling, just under four months before the 2020 election, leaves in place laws in 32 states and the District of Columbia that bind electors to vote for the popular-vote winner, and electors almost always do so anyway.So-called faithless electors have not been critical to the outcome of a presidential election, but that could change in a race decided by just a few electoral votes. It takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court that a state may instruct electors that they have no ground for reversing the vote of millions of its citizens. That direction accords with the Constitution — as well as with the trust of a Nation that here, We the People rule.The justices had scheduled arguments for the spring so they could resolve the issue before the election, rather than amid a potential political crisis after the country votes.When the court heard arguments by telephone in May because of the coronavirus outbreak, justices invoked fears of bribery and chaos if electors could cast their ballots regardless of the popular vote outcome in their states.The issue arose in lawsuits filed by three Hillary Clinton electors in Washington state and one in Colorado who refused to vote for her despite her popular vote win in both states. In so doing, they hoped to persuade enough electors in states won by Donald Trump to choose someone else and deny Trump the presidency.MORE: What Supreme Court decision on Louisiana law means for U.S. abortion rightsThe federal appeals court in Denver ruled that electors can vote as they please, rejecting arguments that they must choose the popular-vote winner. In Washington, the state Supreme Court upheld a $1,000 fine against the three electors and rejected their claims.In all, there were 10 faithless electors in 2016, including a fourth in Washington, a Democratic elector in Hawaii and two Republican electors in Texas. In addition, Democratic electors who said they would not vote for Clinton were replaced in Maine and Minnesota.The closest Electoral College margin in recent years was in 2000, when Republican George W. Bush received 271 votes to 266 for Democrat Al Gore. One elector from Washington, D.C., left her ballot blank.The Supreme Court played a decisive role in that election, ending a recount in Florida, where Bush held a 537-vote margin out of 6 million ballots cast.The justices scheduled separate arguments in the Washington and Colorado cases after Justice Sonia Sotomayor belatedly removed herself from the Colorado case because she knows one of the plaintiffs.In asking the Supreme Court to rule that states can require electors to vote for the state winner, Colorado had urged the justices not to wait until the heat of a close presidential election."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/white-woman-charged-after-central-park-confrontation,White woman charged after Central Park confrontation,Associated Press,"['Jul 6, 2020']","NEW YORK (AP) — A white woman who called the police during a videotaped dispute with a Black man over her walking her dog without a leash in Central Park was charged Monday with filing a false police report.In May, Amy Cooper drew widespread condemnation was fired from her job after frantically calling 911 to claim she was being threatened by an African-American man, bird watcher Christian Cooper. On the video he recorded of the woman, he sounds calm and appears to keep a safe distance from her.District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement on Monday that his office had charged Amy Cooper with falsely reporting the confrontation, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of a year behind bars. She was ordered to appear in court on Oct. 14.Coopers attorney, Robert Barnes, said Cooper would fight the charge. His client, he said, has already lost her livelihood and her public life. Now some demand her freedom?Reached by phone on Monday, Christian Cooper said he had no reaction or comment.After the backlash, Amy Cooper released an apology through a public relations service, saying she reacted emotionally and made false assumptions about his intentions.WATCH: Reasons for hope amid Americas racial unrestHe had every right to request that I leash my dog in an area where it was required, she said in the written statement. I am well aware of the pain that misassumptions and insensitive statements about race cause and would never have imagined that I would be involved in the type of incident that occurred with Chris.Amy Coopers 911 call was seen by many as a stark example of everyday racism and fueled outrage in the period leading up to the street protests sparked by the police custody death of George Floyd. It also inspired New York state lawmakers in June to pass a law that makes it easier under civil rights law to sue an individual who calls a police officer on someone without reason because of their background, including race and national origin.The new law, which the governor also signed last month, holds an individual who makes such 911 calls liable for injunctive relief, damages, or any other appropriate relief in a civil lawsuit. Cooper was charged under an existing false-report law thats been long on the books and doesnt reference race.The confrontation began early one morning when Christian Cooper said he noticed Amy Cooper had let her cocker spaniel off its leash against the rules in the Ramble, a secluded section of Central Park popular with birdwatchers.In the video posted on social media, he claimed the dog was tearing through the plantings and told her she should go to another part of the park. When she refused, he pulled out dog treats, causing her to scream at him to not come near her dog.Amy Cooper also warned him she would summon police unless he stopped recording.Im going to tell them theres an African American man threatening my life, Amy Cooper is heard saying in the video as she pulls down her face mask and struggles to control her dog.Please call the cops, Christian Cooper says.Theres an African American man, Im in Central Park, he is recording me and threatening myself and my dog. … Please send the cops immediately! she says during the call before he stops recording.Police say by the time they responded, they were both gone.___Associated Press writer Michael R.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/south-dakota-governor-exposed-to-virus-joined-trump-on-jet,"South Dakota governor, exposed to virus, joined Trump on jet",Stephen Groves,"['Jul 6, 2020']","SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — Shortly after fireworks above Mount Rushmore disappeared into the night sky on Friday, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem accompanied President Donald Trump aboard Air Force One despite having had close contact with Trumps sons girlfriend, who had tested positive for the coronavirus.Trump has been in a position all along to encounter a virus that spreads from people who dont feel sick, such as Noem, who had interacted closely at a campaign fundraiser with Donald Trump Jr.s girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, who turned out to be sick. Noem didnt wear a mask on the plane and chatted with the president as the flight returned to Washington, D.C., according to her spokesperson, Maggie Seidel.Noem had tested negative for COVID-19 shortly before welcoming Trump to South Dakota on Friday, a day after she had interacted with Guilfoyle. One photo on social media showed Noem and Guilfoyle, who is also a Trump campaign staff member, hugging. The Trump campaign announced that Guilfoyle had tested positive on Friday.Guilfoyles infection prompted some Republicans, such as Rep. Greg Gianforte of Montana, to take precautions against the spread of the coronavirus. He suspended in-person campaigning for his gubernatorial bid after his wife and his running mate both attended a fundraiser with Guilfoyle earlier in the week.Noem doesnt plan anything similar, Seidel said. She cast Noems decision to fly on Air Force One as a demonstration of how to live with the virus. Seidel pointed to comments from the World Health Organization that the spread of the virus is rare from asymptomatic people. But that runs counter to guidance from public health experts, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that advises people to wear masks when interacting with people outside their household.WATCH: How American voters view Trumps handling of racial unrest and COVID-19Asked about Trumps interaction with Noem, the White House noted the frequency with which the president is tested.The president is tested constantly, has tested negative, and those around him are tested as well, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said.When asked why Noem was allowed to travel on Air Force One, McEnany referred the question to the Secret Service, but added: They take the presidents health very seriously. They would never put him in a situation that would put him in harms way.As the number of people hospitalized from COVID-19 in South Dakota has decreased in recent weeks to just 59 people statewide, Noem has doubled down on her relaxed approach to the pandemic. Even as Republican governors in states like Texas have moved to require people to wear masks, Noem didnt require distancing or masks at the July 3 celebration at Mount Rushmore, an outdoor event at which few in the closely packed crowd wore masks.On Friday night, she told the crowd, Tonight, if you look to your left, if you look to your right, youre going to see that this crowd isnt just from South Dakota, but its from everywhere across this nation.The influx of tourists for the Rushmore fireworks has some local leaders and doctors concerned that the area could see a spike in cases.

Elizabeth Warren, saying, Indians, like Elizabeth Warren, must be very angry right now! Trump has repeatedly mocked Warren, who ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, for claiming Native American heritage, derisively calling her Pocahontas.The NFLs Redskins announced Friday that they had begun a thorough review of their name, which has been deemed offensive by Native American groups for decades. The Redskins decision came after FedEx, which paid $205 million for naming rights to the teams stadium, and other corporate partners called for the team to change its nickname.Hours later, the Indians Major League Baseball team announced that they, too, will review their long-debated name.We are committed to making a positive impact in our community and embrace our responsibility to advance social justice and equality, the team said in a statement.On Sunday, Indians manager Terry Francona said he approved of the teams decision, saying it was time to move forward.Cleveland All-Star shortstop Francisco Lindor is also in favor of the Indians changing their nickname, which theyve had since 1915.If changing the name brings more love and more peace to society, Im open to listening to the change of names, Lindor said Monday. I know society is shifting and we are due for some change. So along those guidelines, yeah, Im open for a change in name if its going to bring love and happiness and more peace to the world.Trump has spent the last few days stoking divisions and exploiting racial tensions, accusing protesters who have pushed for racial justice of engaging in a merciless campaign to wipe out our history. Earlier Monday, he lashed out at NASCAR and wrongly accused the sports only full-time Black driver of perpetrating a hoax when a crew member found a noose in the team garage stall.Trump had tweeted in 2013 that then-President Barack Obama should not be telling the Washington Redskins to change their name because our country has far bigger problems!

The creature, which predated dinosaurs and flying pterosaurs, was just shy of 4 inches (10 centimeters) tall, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Some of these things would have been quite cute animals, said study lead author Christian Kammerer, a paleontology researcher at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Looking like a small dinosaur that could fit in your hand, Kammerer mused that it would probably make a great pet. Of course, no humans were around when Kongonaphon was roaming the wild, jumping around with its strong hind legs and feeding on bugs with its peg-like teeth, Kammerer said. The name means tiny bug slayer.The fossils, dug up in Madagascar, date from 237 million years ago. Scientists figure the little guy was an adult because of growth rings in its bones, Kammerer said."

Police may also apply for a warrant that requires a person suspected of violating the national security law to surrender their travel documents, thus restricting them from leaving Hong Kong.Additionally, under the rules, written notices or restraining orders may be issued to freeze or confiscate property if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is related to an offense endangering national security.WATCH: Why this pro-democracy Hong Kong activist decided to flee his homePlatforms and publishers, as well as internet service providers, may also be ordered to take down electronic messages published that are likely to constitute an offence endangering national security or is likely to cause the occurrence of an offence endangering national security.Service providers who do not comply with such requests could face fines of up to 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,903) and receive jail terms of six months.Individuals who post such messages may also be asked to remove the message, or face similar fines and a jail term of one year.Before the release of the implementation rules on Monday, Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram said that they would deny law enforcement requests for user data in Hong Kong as they assess the effect of the national security law.The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new implementation rules.Under the implementation rules, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam may also authorize police to intercept communications and conduct surveillance to prevent and detect offences endangering national security.Finally, written notices may also be served to a foreign political organisation or Taiwan political organisation, or individual agents, to furnish details on their activities related to Hong Kong. This includes details such as personal particulars, assets, income, and expenditure of the organization in Hong Kong. Failure to comply or providing false or incomplete information can result in a fine of 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,903) or imprisonment of six months or two years respectively.The details of the implementation rules come into effect Tuesday and details were released after the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, chaired by Lam, convened its first meeting on Monday.Hong Kongs national security law, imposed last week following anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, makes secessionist, subversive, and terrorist activities illegal, as well as foreign intervention in the citys internal affairs. Any activities such as shouting slogans or holding up banners and flags calling for the citys independence are a violation of the law regardless of whether violence is used. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment.Critics see it as Beijings boldest step yet to erase the legal firewall between the former British colony and the mainlands authoritarian Communist Party system.Hanscom Smith, U.S. consul general to Hong Kong and Macau, said Monday that it is a tragedy to use the semi-autonomous Chinese territorys new national security law to chip away at freedoms in the Asian financial hub.Using the national security law to erode fundamental freedoms and to create an atmosphere of coercion and self-censorship is a tragedy for Hong Kong, Smith told reporters. Hong Kong has been successful precisely because of its openness and well do everything we can to maintain that.Since the law went into effect, the government has specified that the popular protest slogan Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time has separatist connotations and is thus criminalized.In Hong Kongs public libraries, books by pro-democracy figures have been pulled from the shelves, including those written by prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong and politician Tanya Chan. The authority that runs the libraries said it is reviewing the books in light of the new legislation.Many pro-democracy shops that publicly stood in solidarity with protesters have removed pro-democracy notes and artwork that adorned the walls of their stores, fearful that they might violate the new law.A 23-year-old man, Tong Ying-kit, was the first person in Hong Kong to be charged under the new law, for allegedly driving a motorcycle into a group of policemen while bearing a flag with the Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time slogan.Tong appeared in court Monday facing charges of incitement to secession and terrorist activities. He was denied bail.Separately, pro-democracy activists Agnes Chow, Joshua Wong and Ivan Lam also appeared in court Monday over charges related to a protest last June. Chow pleaded guilty to inciting others to participate in an unlawful assembly, as well as to participating in an unauthorized assembly.News Wrap: Controversial Hong Kong security bill becomes lawWong, who was indicted on similar charges, pleaded not guilty. Lam, who was charged with inciting others to participate in an unlawful assembly, also pleaded not guilty. All three were released on bail.With the risk of our personal safety, with the threat of life sentencing, we might be worried, and also being targeted by Beijing, but we also encourage the global community to let our voice be heard in the world, Wong told reporters Monday. We still hope to let the world know that now is the time to stand with Hong Kong, and now is the time for Hong Kongers to keep our momentum.The cases will move to trial and sentencing following a pretrial review for Wong and Lam scheduled for Aug. 5.A group of about 10 protesters gathered at a shopping mall in Hong Kongs Central business district on Monday holding up signs calling for city leader Carrie Lam to step down, as well as reiterating protesters demands from the pro-democracy movement last year. The demands include an independent inquiry into the police and greater democracy.Others held up blank pieces of paper as a sign of protest against the suppression of political protest in the city. About 20 riot police later entered the mall, detaining protesters holding up signs, although they did not appear to make any arrests.We feel worried that we may be convicted for expressing our views, said protester Anthea Wong. Thats why we are using white paper instead.Associated Press journalist Katie Tam contributed to this report."

Trump has the education, insight, and intimate familiarity needed to reveal what makes Donald, and the rest of her clan, tick, a release about the book said.The book is expected to include a number of allegations about President Trump, including how his upbringing led to his worldview and the derision he showed his father after he was diagnosed with Alzheimers disease.The books back cover opens with a biting critique of the president: Today, Donald is much as he was at three years old: incapable of growing, learning, or evolving, unable to regulate his emotions, moderate his responses, or take in and synthesize information."

Thats compared with Uber Eats 23% share before the Postmates deal. Grubhub and its subsidiaries had just under 23% of the U.S. meal delivery market, according to May figures from Second Measure, a data analysis company. Postmates had about 8% of the market.We really believe that the market is much bigger than, lets say, the traditional delivery players, Khosrowshahi said. We look at groceries as a category, theres a lot of hot food being delivered, we look at essentials as a category that we are going to go after as well.Last month, Uber lost out in a bid for Grubhub, which would have made it the dominant U.S. food delivery service. But Amsterdam-based Just Eat Takeaway.com ended up nabbing Chicagos Grubhub in a $7.3 billion deal. Uber was reportedly seeking to team Grubhub with its Uber Eats business.The food delivery sector is undergoing a major consolidation this year and more is expected. The number of people using food delivery services is on the rise because of the coronavirus pandemic, but customers tend to jump around from service to service depending on where they can find the best deal.Some restaurants are already leaving the platforms, saying the commissions — which can top 30% — are too high.The Panda Express chain launched its own delivery service last month, saying delivery companies were making its meals too expensive for consumers. In March, some Washington restaurant and bar owners banded together to start their own delivery service, DC To-GoGo. It currently offers delivery from 18 establishments, and founder Josh Saltzman said its adding more each week.Smaller restaurants, however, lack the muscle to negotiate favorable terms with the third-party platforms, or the capacity to build out their own online ordering service. Many are turning to delivery, despite the costs, as a means surviving pandemic shutdown orders.For restaurants, the deal is not quite as good, said Stephen Beck, managing partner of management consultancy cg42. A consolidation of power, so to speak, and fewer options is not a good thing for the restaurant industry.Third-party delivery orders in the U.S. have risen from 2% of restaurant transactions to about 7% during the pandemic, according to David Portalatin, food industry advisor at the NPD Group. In the month of May, third-party delivery orders rose 170% compared to the previous year, he said.Its a very challenging business to start with and for that reason, you had a lot of independent restaurants who said third-party delivery is not for us. Then, the world changed dramatically overnight, Portalatin said. There has been a dramatic shift, so everybody is participating. That is going to enable the third-party apps to sign up a whole lot of restaurants.WATCH: Uber whistleblower Susan Fowler details harassment, retaliation in new bookFor many restaurants, the price of partnering with third-party platforms is coming on top of the costs of reopening with reduced capacity and other safety restrictions imposed because of the virus, Portalatin said.Unfortunately, some restaurants are going to close, and some are going to evolve, he said.Uber has leaned on its food delivery business with COVID-19 cutting into all ride-share businesses. Ubers rides business slid 3% in the first quarter and dropped 80% in April compared with the same time last year. Bookings through its food delivery business, on the other hand, surged 54% in the first quarter.By acquiring Postmates, Uber not only gets the bigger share of the food delivery market it has long desired, but also shores itself up against further pandemic-related losses in its ride-hailing division.In our opinion, Uber finds itself with its back against the wall on the consolidation theme as the Grubhub deal fell apart on anti-trust concerns, and now must quickly look to acquire market share and added scale which makes the Postmates deal a smart strategic fit, analysts with Wedbush Securities wrote Monday.Postmates, a closely held private company, claims 600,000 food and restaurant merchants to choose from, which it claims is the largest selection in the U.S. The company says it has the ability to serve 80% of households across all 50 states.The boards of both companies have approved the transaction and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.Uber and Postmates are both based in San Francisco.Shares of Uber Technologies Inc. rose $1.84, or 6%, to close Monday at $32.52.AP Business Writers Alexandra Olson in New York and Dee-Ann Durbin in Ann Arbor, Michigan, contributed to this story."

Beaches will reopen on Tuesday after they being closed over the weekend. But if we see crowding and people not following the public health rules, I will be forced to close the beaches again, the mayor warned.READ MORE: Unemployment woes a mounting strain on Trump in FloridaHospitalizations across the state have been ticking upward, with nearly 1,700 patients admitted in the past seven days compared with 1,200 the previous week. Five hospitals in the St. Petersburg area were out of intensive care unit beds, officials said.Miami-Dade said it has more than 1,600 coronavirus patients now in the hospital, more than double from two weeks ago. Miamis Baptist Hospital had only four of its 88 ICU beds available.If we continue to increase at the pace we have been, we wont have enough ventilators, enough rooms, said Dr. David De La Zerda, a respiratory specialist at Miamis Jackson Memorial Hospital.Officials in Texas likewise said hospitals are in danger of being overwhelmed. Hospitalizations statewide surged past 8,000 for the first time over the July Fourth weekend, a more than fourfold increase in the past month. Houston officials said intensive care units there have exceeded capacity.Along the border with Mexico, two severely ill patients were flown hundreds of miles north to Dallas and San Antonio because hospitals in the Rio Grande Valley were full.In Arizona, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 topped 3,200, a new high, and hospitals statewide were at 89% capacity. Confirmed cases surpassed 100,000, and more than half of those infected, or over 62,000, are under 44 years old, state health officials said.Around the country, health officials have warned that the surge is being driven in large part by younger people who are disregarding the social distancing rules and that they could easily spread the virus to older, more vulnerable people, such as their parents and grandparents.The coronavirus is blamed for over a half-million deaths worldwide, including more than 130,000 in the U.S., according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. The number of confirmed infections nationwide stood at 2.9 million, though the real number is believed to be 10 times higher.New cases per day nationwide have hit record levels well over 50,000. The daily count has surged more than 80% over the past two weeks, according to an Associated Press analysis.Average deaths per day have fallen over the same period from around 600 to about 510, in what experts say reflects advances in treatment and prevention as well as the large share of cases among young adults, who are more likely than older ones to survive COVID-19.But deaths are considered a lagging indicator — that is, it takes time for people to get sick and die. And experts are worried the downward trend in deaths could reverse itself.The trajectory of the virus following the July Fourth celebrations is being closely watched as states weigh whether to reopen schools in the coming months.If we dont control things now, were going to see things happening into mid-August to late August, said Dr. Cyrus Shahpar of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit organization that works to prevent epidemics.Meanwhile, three of the top U.S. medical organizations issued an open letter urging Americans to wear masks, social distance and wash hands often to help stop the worst public health crisis in generations.The American Medical Association, American Nurses Association and American Hospital Association issued the plea in the absence of a mask-wearing order from Washington and said steps taken early on that helped slow the spread of COVID-19 were too quickly abandoned.The White House again rejected calls for a nationwide order to wear face coverings. Appearing on Fox and Friends, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said that President Donald Trump sees the issue as a state matter.Were allowing our local governors and our local mayors to weigh in on that, he said.In New York City, once the most lethal hot spot in the country, nail salons and dog runs were allowed to reopen but indoor dining was postponed indefinitely.New York Gov.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/judge-orders-dakota-access-pipeline-shut-down-pending-environmental-review,Judge orders Dakota Access pipeline shut down pending environmental review,Dave Kolpack,"['Jul 6, 2020']","FARGO, N.D. (AP) — A judge on Monday ordered the Dakota Access pipeline shut down for additional environmental review more than three years after it began pumping oil — handing a victory to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and delivering a blow to President Donald Trumps efforts to weaken public health and environmental protections it views as obstacles to businesses.In a 24-page order, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., wrote that he was mindful of the disruption that shutting down the pipeline would cause, but that it must be done within 30 days. Pipeline owner Energy Transfer plans to ask a court to halt the order and will seek an expedited appeal, spokeswoman Vicki Granado said.The order comes after Boesberg said in April that a more extensive review was necessary than what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers already conducted and that he would consider whether the pipeline should be shuttered during the new assessment.The Court does not reach its decision with blithe disregard for the lives it will affect, Boasberg wrote Monday.Yet, given the seriousness of the Corps NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) error, the impossibility of a simple fix, the fact that Dakota Access did assume much of its economic risk knowingly, and the potential harm each day the pipeline operates, the Court is forced to conclude that the flow of oil must cease, he added.The findings may challenge the legal footing for the Trump administrations most momentous environmental rollbacks. Trump surrounded himself with industry leaders and workers in hard hats this January when he announced plans to overhaul the rules for enforcing NEPA.The Dakota Access pipeline was the subject of months of protests in 2016 and 2017, sometimes violent, during its construction near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border. The tribe pressed litigation against the pipeline even after it began carrying oil from North Dakota across South Dakota and Iowa and to a shipping point in Illinois in June 2017.The $3.8 billion, 1,172-mile (1,886 kilometer) pipeline crosses beneath the Missouri River, just north of the reservation. The tribe draws its water from the river and fears pollution.This pipeline should have never been built here. We told them that from the beginning, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Mike Faith said in a statement.Texas-based Energy Transfer contends proper procedures were followed in granting the original easement for the pipeline, Granado said.The economic implications of the Judges order are too big to ignore and we will do all we can to ensure its continued operation, she said. Billions of dollars in tax and royalty revenue will be lost by state, local and tribal governments in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Farmers will suffer as crude transportation will move to rail, displacing corn, wheat and soy crops that would normally be moved to market. Ironically, the counties along these rail lines will face increased environmental risks due to the increased amount of crude oil traveling by rail.Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, decried what he called a shocking ruling and noted that the pipeline is moving 570,000 barrels of Bakken oil a day.Before the coronavirus pandemic devastated the U.S. oil industry, daily oil production in North Dakota — the nations No. 2 oil producer behind Texas — was at a near-record 1.45 million barrels daily. The states output slipped to below 1 million barrels daily in May amid low energy prices and sparse demand.Permits for the project were originally rejected by the Obama administration, and the Army Corps of Engineers prepared to conduct a full environmental review. In February 2017, after Trump took office, the Corps scrapped the review and granted permits, concluding that running the pipeline under the Missouri River posed no significant environmental issues.The Corps said that opinion was validated after an additional year of review, as ordered by Boasberg, an Obama appointee, in 2017.Boasberg ruled then that the Corps largely complied with environmental law when permitting the pipeline but ordered more review because he said the agency did not adequately consider how an oil spill under the Missouri River might affect the Standing Rock Siouxs fishing and hunting rights, or whether it might disproportionately affect the tribal community.Associated Press writers James MacPherson in Bismarck, N.D., and Ellen Knickmeyer in Oklahoma City contributed to this story."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/making-people-aware-of-their-implicit-biases-doesnt-usually-change-minds-but-heres-what-does-work,Making people aware of their implicit biases doesnt usually change minds. But heres what does work,Betsy Mason,"['Jun 10, 2020']","This interview with psychologist Anthony Greenwald was republished with permission from Knowable Magazine. The original article was published on June 4, 2020. A quarter-century ago, social psychologist Anthony Greenwald of the University of Washington developed a test that exposed an uncomfortable aspect of the human mind: People have deep-seated biases of which they are completely unaware. And these hidden attitudes — known as implicit bias — influence the way we act toward each other, often with unintended discriminatory consequences.Since then, Greenwald and his main collaborators, Mahzarin Banaji and Brian Nosek, have used the implicit association test to measure how fast and accurately people associate different social groups with qualities like good and bad. They have developed versions of the test to measure things such as unconscious attitudes about race, gender stereotypes and bias against older people. Those tests have revealed just how pervasive implicit bias is. (Project Implicit offers public versions of the tests on its website here.)The researchers work has also shown how much implicit bias can shape social behavior and decision-making. Even people with the best intentions are influenced by these hidden attitudes, behaving in ways that can create disparities in hiring practices, student evaluations, law enforcement, criminal proceedings — pretty much anywhere people are making decisions that affect others. Such disparities can result from bias against certain groups, or favoritism toward other ones. Today, implicit bias is widely understood to be a cause of unintended discrimination that leads to racial, ethnic, socioeconomic and other inequalities.Discussions around the role of racism and implicit bias in the pattern of unequal treatment of racial minorities by law enforcement are intensifying following a roster of high-profile cases, most recently the killing of George Floyd. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis last month after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyds neck for nearly nine minutes.As awareness of implicit bias and its effects has increased, so has interest in mitigating it. But that is much harder to do than scientists expected, as Greenwald told an audience in Seattle in February at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Greenwald, coauthor of an overview on implicit bias research in the 2020 Annual Review of Psychology, spoke with Knowable Magazine about what does and doesnt work to counter the disparities that implicit bias can produce.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.How do you test for associations that people arent aware they have?The first implicit association test I created was one involving the names of flowers and insects, and words meaning things pleasant or unpleasant. You had to use left and right hands to classify them, tapping on a keyboard as they appeared on the screen. It was a very easy task when you had to use the right hand for both pleasant words and flower names, and the left hand for unpleasant words and insect names, because we typically think of flowers as pleasant and insects as unpleasant.But then the task is switched to force the opposite associations — one hand for insect names and pleasant words, and the other hand for flower names and unpleasant words. When I first tried that reversed form, my response time was about a third of a second slower compared to the first version. And in psychological work where youre asking people to respond rapidly, a third of a second is like an eternity, indicating that some mental processes are going on in this version of the test that are not going on in the other.Then I replaced the flowers and insects with first names of men and women that are easily classified as European American or African American. For me, giving the same response to pleasant words and African American names took an eternity. But when it was the European American names and pleasant words with one hand, and the African American names and the unpleasant words with the other hand, that was something I could zip through. And that was a surprise to me. I would have described myself at that point as someone who is lacking in biases or prejudices of a racial nature. I probably had some biases that I would confess to, but I actually didnt think I had that one.How widespread is implicit bias?That particular implicit bias, the one involving black-white race, shows up in about 70 percent to 75 percent of all Americans who try the test. It shows up more strongly in white Americans and Asian Americans than in mixed-race or African Americans. African Americans, youd think, might show just the reverse effect — that it would be easy for them to put African American together with pleasant and white American together with unpleasant. But no, African Americans show, on average, neither direction of bias on that task.Most people have multiple implicit biases they arent aware of. It is much more widespread than is generally assumed.Is implicit bias a factor in the pattern of police violence such as that seen in the killing of George Floyd on May 25, which sparked the ongoing protests across the country?The problems surfacing in the wake of George Floyds death include all forms of bias, ranging from implicit bias to structural bias built into the operation of police departments, courts and governments, to explicit, intended bias, to hate crime.The best theory of how implicit bias works is that it shapes conscious thought, which in turn guides judgments and decisions. The ABC News correspondent Pierre Thomas expressed this very well recently by saying, Black people feel like they are being treated as suspects first and citizens second. When a black person does something that is open to alternative interpretations, like reaching into a pocket or a cars glove compartment, many people — not just police officers — may think first that its possibly dangerous. But that wouldnt happen in viewing a white person do exactly the same action. The implications of conscious judgment being shaped in this way by an automatic, implicit process of which the perceiver is unaware can assume great importance in outcomes of interactions with police.Do the diversity or implicit bias training programs used by companies and institutions like Starbucks and the Oakland Police Department help reduce bias?Im at the moment very skeptical about most of whats offered under the label of implicit bias training, because the methods being used have not been tested scientifically to indicate that they are effective. And theyre using it without trying to assess whether the training they do is achieving the desired results.I see most implicit bias training as window dressing that looks good both internally to an organization and externally, as if youre concerned and trying to do something. But it can be deployed without actually achieving anything, which makes it in fact counterproductive. After 10 years of doing this stuff and nobody reporting data, I think the logical conclusion is that if it was working, we would have heard about it.Can you tell us about some of the approaches meant to reduce bias that havent worked?Ill give you several examples of techniques that have been tried with the assumption that they would achieve whats sometimes called debiasing or reducing implicit biases. One is exposure to counter-stereotypic examples, like seeing examples of admirable scientists or entertainers or others who are African American alongside examples of whites who are mass murderers. And that produces an immediate effect. You can show that it will actually affect a test result if you measure it within about a half-hour. But it was recently found that when people started to do these tests with longer delays, a day or more, any beneficial effect appears to be gone.Implicit bias is pervasiveHundreds of studies have revealed the workings of implicit bias in a wide range of settings. Here are a few examples that demonstrate how it can occur in just about any situation in which people make decisions that affect other people.In law enforcement: A study found that police in New York City stopped black and Hispanic pedestrians more often than white pedestrians, and a study in Oakland, California, found that black men were far more likely to be handcuffed, searched or arrested than anyone else when stopped by police.In the office: Hiring managers were less likely to invite an obese applicant for an interview, people see older workers as less valuable and bias against Arab-Muslim men influenced hiring decisions in Sweden.In the courtroom: Studies found that implicit bias against African Americans affects almost every step in the judicial system, from prosecutors deciding which cases to charge to judges handing down decisions.In the classroom: Public high school teachers in Sweden gave higher test scores to students with Swedish backgrounds than those with foreign ones, while American psychology students rated young male teachers higher than older men, as well as younger and older women.In the hospital: Doctors were more likely to offer a blood-clot-busting treatment to white patients with acute coronary disease than to black patients with the same symptoms, and nursing students showed a bias against overweight patients.In a pandemic? A study showed that when people feel especially vulnerable to infectious disease, their negative attitudes toward older adults may be heightened.—Betsy MasonOther strategies that havent been very effective include just encouraging people to have a strong intention not to allow themselves to be biased. Or trainers will suggest people do something that they may call thinking slow or pausing before making decisions. Another method that has been tried is meditation. And another strategy is making people aware that they have implicit biases or that implicit biases are pervasive in the population. All these may seem reasonable, but theres no empirical demonstration that they work.Its surprising to me that making people aware of their bias doesnt do anything to mitigate it. Why do you think that is?I think youre right, it is surprising. The mechanisms by which our brains form associations and acquire them from the cultural environment evolved over long periods of time, during which people lived in an environment that was consistent. They were not actually likely to acquire something that they would later have to unlearn, because the environment wasnt going to change. So there may have been no evolutionary pressure for the human brain to develop a method of unlearning the associations.I dont know why we have not succeeded in developing effective techniques to reduce implicit biases as they are measured by the implicit association test. Im not prepared to say that were never going to be able to do it, but I will say that people have been looking for a long time, ever since the test was introduced, which is over 20 years now, and this hasnt been solved yet.Is there anything that does work?I think that a lot can be achieved just by collecting data to document disparities that are occurring as a result of bias. And maybe an easy example is police operations, although it can be applied in many settings. Most police departments keep data on what we know as profiling, though they dont like to call it that. Its what happens in a traffic stop or a pedestrian stop — for example, the stop-and-frisk policy that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has taken heat for. The data of the New York City Police Department for stops of black and white pedestrians and drivers were analyzed, and it was very clear that there were disparities.Once you know where the problem is that has to be solved, its up to the administrators to figure out ways to understand why and how this is happening. Is it happening in just some parts of the city? Is it that the police are just operating more in Harlem than in the white neighborhoods?And once you know whats happening, the next step is what I call discretion elimination. This can be applied when people are making decisions that involve subjective judgment about a person. This could be police officers, employers making hiring or promotion decisions, doctors deciding on a patients treatment, or teachers making decisions about students performance. When those decisions are made with discretion, they are likely to result in unintended disparities. But when those decisions are made based on predetermined, objective criteria that are rigorously applied, they are much less likely to produce disparities.Is there evidence that discretion elimination works?What we know comes from the rare occasions in which the effects of discretion elimination have been recorded and reported. The classic example of this is when major symphony orchestras in the United States started using blind auditions in the 1970s. This was originally done because musicians thought that the auditions were biased in favor of graduates of certain schools like the Juilliard School. They werent concerned about gender discrimination.But as soon as auditions started to be made behind screens so the performer could not be seen, the share of women hired as instrumentalists in major symphony orchestras rose from around 10 percent or 20 percent before 1970 to about 40 percent. This has had a major impact on the rate at which women have become instrumentalists in major symphony orchestras.But these data-collection and discretion-elimination strategies arent commonly used?Not nearly as often as they could. For example, instructors can usually arrange to grade almost anything that a student does without knowing the identity of the student. In an electronic age when you dont learn to recognize peoples handwriting, instructors can grade essays without the students names on them. I used that approach when I was last grading undergraduates in courses. Its easy to use, but its often not used at all.And in many other circumstances it is possible to evaluate performance without knowing the identity of the person being evaluated. But employers and others rarely forgo the opportunity to know the identity of the person theyre evaluating.Can artificial intelligence play a role?People are starting to apply artificial intelligence to the task by mining historical records of past employment decisions. This is a way of taking the decisions that involve human discretion and putting them into the hands of a machine. The idea is to develop algorithms that identify promising applicants by matching their qualities to those of past applicants who turned out to be successful employees.I think its a great thing to try. But so far, efforts with AI have not succeeded, because the historical databases used to develop the algorithms to make these decisions turn out to be biased, too. They incorporate the biases of past decision-makers. One example is how biases affect facial-recognition technology, which inadvertently categorizes African American faces or Asian faces as criminal more often than white faces.READ MORE: Explore Knowables coronavirus coverageThis is a problem that computer scientists are trying to cope with, but some of the people in AI that I have spoken to seem not so optimistic that this will be at all easy to do. But I do think that ultimately — and it might take a while — the biases may be expunged more readily from AI decision algorithms than from human decision-making.Could more be done at the level of an individual company or department?To help prevent unintended discrimination, the leaders of organizations need to decide to track data to see where disparities are occurring. When they discover disparities, they need to try to make changes and then look at the next cycle of data to see if those changes are improving things.Obviously, its easier for them not to do those things. In some cases theres a cost to doing them. And they may think its like opening up Pandoras box if they look closely at the data. I think this is true of many police departments. Theyre bound to find things that theyd rather not see.This article originally appeared in Knowable Magazine, an independent journalistic endeavor from Annual Reviews. Sign up for the newsletter."

It takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court that a state may instruct electors that they have no ground for reversing the vote of millions of its citizens.

Federal authorities ruled last month that the rope had been hanging there since at least last October and was not a hate crime. Wallace has maintained the rope had been fashioned into a noose.Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? Trump tweeted. That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!The tweet came after Trump used a pair of Independence Day speeches to dig deeper into Americas divisions by accusing protesters who have pushed for racial justice of engaging in a merciless campaign to wipe out our history. The remarks served as a direct appeal to the Republican presidents political base, including many disaffected white voters, with less than four months to go before Election Day.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the presidents decision to wade into the Wallace case, saying in an interview on Fox News Channel that, The presidents merely pointing out that weve got to let facts come out before we jump to judgment.Wallace, an Alabama native, has taken an active role in the push for racial equality. He has worn a shirt saying I Cant Breathe, raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia and successfully lobbied for NASCARs Confederate flag ban.For more than 70 years, the flag was a common and complicated sight at NASCAR races. The series first tried to ban the Confederate flag five years ago but did nothing to enforce the order.While Trump claimed NASCARs ratings are down, they are actually up."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-live-answering-your-questions-on-race-in-the-workplace,5 ways to approach racial equity at work,Courtney Vinopal,"['Jun 5, 2020']","The death of George Floyd and the protests that have followed sparked a national dialogue about race in America. For many, discussions about race and the reality of living in America as a black person happen daily. But many households, communities and workplaces are having these conversations for the first time. How can employers and colleagues better support employees of color? What is the most productive way to talk about race in the workplace?Watch this discussion in the video player above.Raël Nelson James, the director of diversity, equity and inclusion at The Bridgespan Group and the PBS NewsHours Stephanie Sy took viewer questions on navigating discussions of race at work.The traumatic events of the past few weeks can be a catalyst to kick off discussions about race, diversity and inclusion in the workplace, James said, but cautioned that employees should be sensitive about how they approach it.  James stressed that allyship is not a destination, and employers will have to put in the work to learn and think deeply about how they can reform their workplace dynamics to better advocate for and uplift diverse talent within their workplaces, as well as commit to pursuing racial equity. Here is some advice from James about how employees can start to think and act on  this in the coming days and weeks.  READ MORE: What we know about George Floyds death in Minneapolis police custodyWhat do employees of color want to see in their workplaces?While workplaces may see the events of the past week as a prime opportunity for rethinking their approach toward race, James cautioned against pursuing too much, too quickly. If your company or your organization is new to multiracial dialogue, I would posit that this week, emotions are too raw to kick off that effort, she said.What folks, I think, need this week is psychologically safe spaces to process this without putting a burden on people of color to be educators, James said, noting that asking black employees to educate, process and absorb the emotions of their white colleagues during a moment of immense social unrest is akin to assigning them a second job. While building multiracial dialogue in the workplace is a valuable goal, James said, Its not something to just dive into this week when tensions and emotions are running high. Multiracial dialogue is a complex, nuanced thing that takes skill to do well, she added, saying that companies should start thinking about hiring a professional who can guide their office to a path toward racial equity before pursuing these efforts on their own. How can white supervisors advocate and make space for their brown and black staff?James said that white supervisors checking in on employees of color should be cautious of asking questions such as are you okay? While it may be well-intentioned, No one is okay, and it comes across as tone-deaf, James said of this approach, particularly during this moment of national crisis. What folks, I think, need this week is psychologically safe spaces to process this without putting a burden on people of color to be educators.Model some of the vulnerability and some of the empathy that one would hope is extended to you as well, James said, noting that while this is a collective moment of grieving and of sadness for black people, it should be a moment of grieving, sadness and outrage for all people.James added that managers and supervisors should think about how they can give their employees of color space to process the traumatic events — in both the short and long-term — as they move forward. On the short-term, for example, they can be more flexible with granting employees leave. In the long run, they should think about how they can root out and eliminate the manifestations of structural racism in their office by supporting and promoting employees of color, diversifying their boards, and bringing in experts specializing in diversity, equity and inclusion to help them in doing so. How can you advocate for racial equity if not in a position of leadership?James said that employees who are hoping to see their office pursue racial equity should seek out colleagues who will identify themselves as allies and work on this alongside them. At James organization, The Bridgespan Group, they did something similar after the death of Michael Brown in 2014. It was a similarly difficult time where black folks and other people of color were navigating this sort of grief and wondering if anyone else was having a similar experience in the workplace, James said. After gathering together, James said, Bridgespan formed a racial equity working group to help shepherd their commitment to racial equity.She encouraged employees seeking this in the workplace to create a space where others can raise their hand, identify themselves as allies, identify themselves as other people who want to work on this with you.Are there ways employees can engage beyond their social media accounts?Asked about the recent surge of posts circulating on social media in support of the black community, James said that while she understands people may be processing this moment in different ways, the best way to support black colleagues and friends is to reach out in person to those with whom you already share an authentic relationship. Intellectually I understand why the deaths of George Floyd and Tony McDade and Breonna Taylor have created a crescendo in this moment, James said of the recent flood of interest in Black Lives Matter and other movements against police brutality on social media. But she said that reaching out to a colleague simply because they are black and especially if you dont have a preexisting rapport with them is unhelpful and its draining during a time when we are already exhausted.Instead, James said, you can reach out to comfort and support black colleagues with whom you feel close. Alternatively, she said you should ask yourself, have I done the things … to build relationships with the black people in my community at my job, do I have that kind of trustful relationship? If you havent, consider making a personal commitment to donate money or take a class on inclusive management, for example. James said that making a commitment to do better by colleagues of color will mean more for this community in the long run than emails, texts, or other performative displays of support such as social media posts. Why color blindness misses the markWhile it may be tempting to shift the focus away from race in an effort to boost unity at a moment like this, James cautioned against doing so. Color blindness fundamentally misses the mark by erasing something thats fundamental to peoples identity and peoples self-love, said James, noting that being black is a centering and central part of her identity and she wants people to appreciate her because of that, not in spite of it.  She added that black Americans have spent their lives learning about whiteness and what it means to be white in the U.S., but said that white people might be hesitant to reciprocate that. Instead of pushing the issue away, James recommended that workplace employees lean into the kind of discomfort it might take to become an ally to marginalized communities and devote themselves to pursuing that path.

On the video he recorded of the woman, he sounds calm and appears to keep a safe distance from her.District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement on Monday that his office had charged Amy Cooper with falsely reporting the confrontation, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of a year behind bars. She was ordered to appear in court on Oct. 14.Coopers attorney, Robert Barnes, said Cooper would fight the charge. His client, he said, has already lost her livelihood and her public life. Now some demand her freedom?Reached by phone on Monday, Christian Cooper said he had no reaction or comment.After the backlash, Amy Cooper released an apology through a public relations service, saying she reacted emotionally and made false assumptions about his intentions.WATCH: Reasons for hope amid Americas racial unrestHe had every right to request that I leash my dog in an area where it was required, she said in the written statement. I am well aware of the pain that misassumptions and insensitive statements about race cause and would never have imagined that I would be involved in the type of incident that occurred with Chris.Amy Coopers 911 call was seen by many as a stark example of everyday racism and fueled outrage in the period leading up to the street protests sparked by the police custody death of George Floyd. It also inspired New York state lawmakers in June to pass a law that makes it easier under civil rights law to sue an individual who calls a police officer on someone without reason because of their background, including race and national origin.The new law, which the governor also signed last month, holds an individual who makes such 911 calls liable for injunctive relief, damages, or any other appropriate relief in a civil lawsuit. Cooper was charged under an existing false-report law thats been long on the books and doesnt reference race.The confrontation began early one morning when Christian Cooper said he noticed Amy Cooper had let her cocker spaniel off its leash against the rules in the Ramble, a secluded section of Central Park popular with birdwatchers.In the video posted on social media, he claimed the dog was tearing through the plantings and told her she should go to another part of the park. When she refused, he pulled out dog treats, causing her to scream at him to not come near her dog.Amy Cooper also warned him she would summon police unless he stopped recording.Im going to tell them theres an African American man threatening my life, Amy Cooper is heard saying in the video as she pulls down her face mask and struggles to control her dog.Please call the cops, Christian Cooper says.Theres an African American man, Im in Central Park, he is recording me and threatening myself and my dog. … Please send the cops immediately! she says during the call before he stops recording.Police say by the time they responded, they were both gone.___Associated Press writer Michael R.

Noem didnt wear a mask on the plane and chatted with the president as the flight returned to Washington, D.C., according to her spokesperson, Maggie Seidel.Noem had tested negative for COVID-19 shortly before welcoming Trump to South Dakota on Friday, a day after she had interacted with Guilfoyle.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/two-thirds-of-black-americans-dont-trust-the-police-to-treat-them-equally-most-white-americans-do,Two-thirds of black Americans dont trust the police to treat them equally. Most white Americans do.,Laura Santhanam,"['Jun 5, 2020']","Nearly half of black Americans have very little or no confidence that police officers in their community treat people with different skin colors the same, according to the latest PBS NewsHour-NPR-Marist poll. But overall, only 18 percent of Americans take that view — an illustration in itself that people of different races are living different realities in the United States. In the days since George Floyds death cracked open the country with demonstrations of people calling for the end of racism in policing, a third of all Americans — 35 percent — said they have a great deal of confidence that police officers in their communities treat black and white people equally, in this poll conducted June 2-3.Community trust in law enforcement has eroded somewhat over the past few years, as police-involved killings of black people have come to national attention, prompting pain and outrage. In December 2014, months after the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, a larger number — 41 percent of Americans — had a high degree of confidence in police.Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourBlack communities are often over-policed and over-profiled, which can even lead to fatality, as recent cases have shown us, said Dr. Michael Lindsey, who directs the McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research at New York University and has studied the effects of racism on mental health in black youth. Will an interaction with the police result in an outcome characterized by physical harm or unequal treatment by the court system? That is a real concern for black Americans.To Lindsey, the views expressed in this nationally representative poll of 1,062 U.S. adults correspond with a history of negative interactions and experiences between the police and blacks.A 2019 study showed that black men and boys face much higher risk of being killed by police in their lifetimes — 96 deaths out of 100,000 are at the hands of police — than do white men and boys, whose likelihood of death by cop is 39 out of 100,000. While this poll asked specifically about perceptions about policing of black and white people, reports of police violence in brown communities have also gained greater awareness in recent years.Protest or unlawfulness?Floyds death and some of his last words, I cant breathe — the same words spoken by Eric Garner, another black man whose death after being restrained by police was caught on video — ignited protests last week that have spread to dozens of cities across the country and show no signs of stopping. Some protests have exploded into intentional acts of property damage and ransacking of stores, and been marked by sometimes debilitating or deadly use of force by police.I had seen police brutality already, in real life and on [the TV], protester Devin Hinnant told PBS NewsHours Yamiche Alcindor in Washington. But something about hearing Floyd say, I cant breathe, made Hinnant feel he needed to know why that officer thought it was permissible to keep his knee on that mans neck, three minutes after he died.In the U.S., nearly two-thirds of Americans view the rallies and marches as mostly legitimate protests. That includes 87 percent of Democrats and 65 percent of independents. Just 28 percent of U.S. adults overall believe people are mostly acting unlawfully, including a higher proportion of Republicans —  59 percent. Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourThe protests have exposed generational fault lines on issues of race,with nearly three-quarters of Gen Z and millennials — those aged 18-39 — believing the protests are legitimate, compared to 60 percent of Generation X, 55 percent of baby boomers, and 48 percent of those over the age of 74. In many communities where people demonstrated, police used rubber bullets and tear gas to control crowds, in some cases severely injuring people. In one instance, photographer Linda Tirado lost sight in one eye after she said she was shot with a rubber bullet during a protest in Minneapolis. The citys police department disputed the claim.

Another 38 percent said police have mostly responded appropriately, including 41 percent of white Americans, 39 percent of Latinos and 32 percent of African Americans. Only 18 percent think police werent acting aggressively enough, including 20 percent of white respondents, 13 percent of Latinos, and 6 percent of African Americans.Trumps response to demonstrationsSixty-seven percent of Americans think President Donald Trump has mostly increased tensions since Floyds death, while 18 percent believe he has mostly decreased tensions.Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourOn May 29, Trump called protesters thugs and suggested he would respond with military force to control the situation, drawing criticism for stoking tensions.  These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I wont let that happen, Trump tweeted. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. In an unprecedented move, Twitter hid the tweet on his timeline behind a warning that said it violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence.READ MORE: Trumps tweet about rioters echoes 1960s Miami police chief"

Federal authorities ruled last month that the rope had been hanging there since at least last October and was not a hate crime. Wallace has maintained the rope had been fashioned into a noose and has said he was saddened by the despicable act of racism and hatred, and other Cup Series drivers rallied around him.Has BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? Trump tweeted. That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the presidents decision to wade into the Wallace case, saying that reporters were mischaracterizing the presidents tweet and were taking his comments about the Confederate flag out of context.The whole point of the tweet was to note the incident, the alleged hate crime that was not in fact a hate crime, she said.McEnany said the president rejects this notion that somehow NASCAR men and women, who go to these sporting events, are racists, and that the FBI report on the matter was an indictment of the medias rush to judgment.Wallace, an Alabama native, has taken an active role in the push for racial equality. He has worn a shirt saying I Cant Breathe, raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia and successfully lobbied for NASCARs Confederate flag ban.For more than 70 years, the flag was a common and complicated sight at NASCAR races. The series first tried to ban the Confederate flag five years ago but did nothing to enforce the order.While Trump claimed NASCARs ratings are down, they are actually up."

The creature, which predated dinosaurs and flying pterosaurs, was just shy of 4 inches (10 centimeters) tall, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Some of these things would have been quite cute animals, said study lead author Christian Kammerer, a paleontology researcher at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Looking like a small dinosaur that could fit in your hand, Kammerer mused that it would probably make a great pet. Of course, no humans were around when Kongonaphon was roaming the wild, jumping around with its strong hind legs and feeding on bugs with its peg-like teeth, Kammerer said. The name means tiny bug slayer.The fossils, dug up in Madagascar, date from 237 million years ago. Scientists figure the little guy was an adult because of growth rings in its bones, Kammerer said."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-live-answering-your-questions-on-race-in-the-workplace,5 ways to approach racial equity at work,Courtney Vinopal,"['Jun 5, 2020']","The death of George Floyd and the protests that have followed sparked a national dialogue about race in America. For many, discussions about race and the reality of living in America as a black person happen daily. But many households, communities and workplaces are having these conversations for the first time. How can employers and colleagues better support employees of color? What is the most productive way to talk about race in the workplace?Watch this discussion in the video player above.Raël Nelson James, the director of diversity, equity and inclusion at The Bridgespan Group and the PBS NewsHours Stephanie Sy took viewer questions on navigating discussions of race at work.The traumatic events of the past few weeks can be a catalyst to kick off discussions about race, diversity and inclusion in the workplace, James said, but cautioned that employees should be sensitive about how they approach it.  James stressed that allyship is not a destination, and employers will have to put in the work to learn and think deeply about how they can reform their workplace dynamics to better advocate for and uplift diverse talent within their workplaces, as well as commit to pursuing racial equity. Here is some advice from James about how employees can start to think and act on  this in the coming days and weeks.  READ MORE: What we know about George Floyds death in Minneapolis police custodyWhat do employees of color want to see in their workplaces?While workplaces may see the events of the past week as a prime opportunity for rethinking their approach toward race, James cautioned against pursuing too much, too quickly. If your company or your organization is new to multiracial dialogue, I would posit that this week, emotions are too raw to kick off that effort, she said.What folks, I think, need this week is psychologically safe spaces to process this without putting a burden on people of color to be educators, James said, noting that asking black employees to educate, process and absorb the emotions of their white colleagues during a moment of immense social unrest is akin to assigning them a second job. While building multiracial dialogue in the workplace is a valuable goal, James said, Its not something to just dive into this week when tensions and emotions are running high. Multiracial dialogue is a complex, nuanced thing that takes skill to do well, she added, saying that companies should start thinking about hiring a professional who can guide their office to a path toward racial equity before pursuing these efforts on their own. How can white supervisors advocate and make space for their brown and black staff?James said that white supervisors checking in on employees of color should be cautious of asking questions such as are you okay? While it may be well-intentioned, No one is okay, and it comes across as tone-deaf, James said of this approach, particularly during this moment of national crisis. What folks, I think, need this week is psychologically safe spaces to process this without putting a burden on people of color to be educators.Model some of the vulnerability and some of the empathy that one would hope is extended to you as well, James said, noting that while this is a collective moment of grieving and of sadness for black people, it should be a moment of grieving, sadness and outrage for all people.James added that managers and supervisors should think about how they can give their employees of color space to process the traumatic events — in both the short and long-term — as they move forward. On the short-term, for example, they can be more flexible with granting employees leave. In the long run, they should think about how they can root out and eliminate the manifestations of structural racism in their office by supporting and promoting employees of color, diversifying their boards, and bringing in experts specializing in diversity, equity and inclusion to help them in doing so. How can you advocate for racial equity if not in a position of leadership?James said that employees who are hoping to see their office pursue racial equity should seek out colleagues who will identify themselves as allies and work on this alongside them. At James organization, The Bridgespan Group, they did something similar after the death of Michael Brown in 2014. It was a similarly difficult time where black folks and other people of color were navigating this sort of grief and wondering if anyone else was having a similar experience in the workplace, James said. After gathering together, James said, Bridgespan formed a racial equity working group to help shepherd their commitment to racial equity.She encouraged employees seeking this in the workplace to create a space where others can raise their hand, identify themselves as allies, identify themselves as other people who want to work on this with you.Are there ways employees can engage beyond their social media accounts?Asked about the recent surge of posts circulating on social media in support of the black community, James said that while she understands people may be processing this moment in different ways, the best way to support black colleagues and friends is to reach out in person to those with whom you already share an authentic relationship. Intellectually I understand why the deaths of George Floyd and Tony McDade and Breonna Taylor have created a crescendo in this moment, James said of the recent flood of interest in Black Lives Matter and other movements against police brutality on social media. But she said that reaching out to a colleague simply because they are black and especially if you dont have a preexisting rapport with them is unhelpful and its draining during a time when we are already exhausted.Instead, James said, you can reach out to comfort and support black colleagues with whom you feel close. Alternatively, she said you should ask yourself, have I done the things … to build relationships with the black people in my community at my job, do I have that kind of trustful relationship? If you havent, consider making a personal commitment to donate money or take a class on inclusive management, for example. James said that making a commitment to do better by colleagues of color will mean more for this community in the long run than emails, texts, or other performative displays of support such as social media posts. Why color blindness misses the markWhile it may be tempting to shift the focus away from race in an effort to boost unity at a moment like this, James cautioned against doing so. Color blindness fundamentally misses the mark by erasing something thats fundamental to peoples identity and peoples self-love, said James, noting that being black is a centering and central part of her identity and she wants people to appreciate her because of that, not in spite of it.  She added that black Americans have spent their lives learning about whiteness and what it means to be white in the U.S., but said that white people might be hesitant to reciprocate that. Instead of pushing the issue away, James recommended that workplace employees lean into the kind of discomfort it might take to become an ally to marginalized communities and devote themselves to pursuing that path.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/tell-all-book-by-trump-niece-will-be-released-sooner-than-previously-planned,Tell-all book by Trump niece will be released sooner than previously planned,Associated Press,"['Jul 6, 2020']","NEW YORK (AP) — A tell-all book by President Donald Trumps niece that has been the subject of a legal battle will be released next week.Publisher Simon & Schuster cited high interest and extraordinary interest in the book by Mary Trump titled Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the Worlds Most Dangerous Man. The book was originally set for release on July 28, but will now arrive on July 14.The revised date, announced Monday, came after a New York appellate court cleared the way for the books publication following a legal challenge by Trumps brother.The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the release date change.Robert Trump had sued Mary Trump to block publication of a book promoted to contain an insiders perspective of countless holiday meals, family interactions and family events.A judge last week left in place a restraint that blocked Mary Trump and any agent of hers from distributing the book, but the court made clear it was not considering Simon & Schuster to be covered by the ruling. The publisher has said that 75,000 first-run editions had already been sent to bookstores.Mary Trump is the daughter of Fred Trump Jr., the presidents elder brother, who died in 1981. She has a doctorate in psychology.Mary L. Trump has the education, insight, and intimate familiarity needed to reveal what makes Donald, and the rest of her clan, tick, a release about the book said.The book is expected to include a number of allegations about President Trump, including how his upbringing led to his worldview and the derision he showed his father after he was diagnosed with Alzheimers disease.The books back cover opens with a biting critique of the president: Today, Donald is much as he was at three years old: incapable of growing, learning, or evolving, unable to regulate his emotions, moderate his responses, or take in and synthesize information."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/uber-buys-postmates-in-2-65-billion-deal,Uber buys Postmates in $2.65 billion deal,Matt Ott,"['Jul 6, 2020']","SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) — Uber has widened its reach in the fiercely competitive delivery market by acquiring Postmates in a $2.65 billion all-stock deal, the company said Monday.The acquisition enables the ride-hailing giant to increase its delivery offerings at a time when the global pandemic has suppressed customers desire for rides while boosting home delivery needs. While Ubers meal delivery business, Uber Eats, has mostly focused on restaurants, Postmates delivers a wider array of goods including groceries, pharmacy items, alcoholic drinks and party supplies.The vision for us is to become an everyday service, said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, in a conference call with investors Monday. Postmates is a great step along that vision. Anyplace you want to go, anything you want delivered to your home, Uber is going to be there with you, and we think these everyday frequent interactions create a habit, create a connection with customers.WATCH: With food-delivery apps like Uber Eats, whos actually making money?Uber and its Uber Eats food-delivery division will gain ground against DoorDash, which controls about 44% of the U.S. meal delivery market. Thats compared with Uber Eats 23% share before the Postmates deal. Grubhub and its subsidiaries had just under 23% of the U.S. meal delivery market, according to May figures from Second Measure, a data analysis company. Postmates had about 8% of the market.We really believe that the market is much bigger than, lets say, the traditional delivery players, Khosrowshahi said. We look at groceries as a category, theres a lot of hot food being delivered, we look at essentials as a category that we are going to go after as well.Last month, Uber lost out in a bid for Grubhub, which would have made it the dominant U.S. food delivery service. But Amsterdam-based Just Eat Takeaway.com ended up nabbing Chicagos Grubhub in a $7.3 billion deal. Uber was reportedly seeking to team Grubhub with its Uber Eats business.The food delivery sector is undergoing a major consolidation this year and more is expected. The number of people using food delivery services is on the rise because of the coronavirus pandemic, but customers tend to jump around from service to service depending on where they can find the best deal.Some restaurants are already leaving the platforms, saying the commissions — which can top 30% — are too high.The Panda Express chain launched its own delivery service last month, saying delivery companies were making its meals too expensive for consumers. In March, some Washington restaurant and bar owners banded together to start their own delivery service, DC To-GoGo. It currently offers delivery from 18 establishments, and founder Josh Saltzman said its adding more each week.Smaller restaurants, however, lack the muscle to negotiate favorable terms with the third-party platforms, or the capacity to build out their own online ordering service. Many are turning to delivery, despite the costs, as a means surviving pandemic shutdown orders.For restaurants, the deal is not quite as good, said Stephen Beck, managing partner of management consultancy cg42. A consolidation of power, so to speak, and fewer options is not a good thing for the restaurant industry.Third-party delivery orders in the U.S. have risen from 2% of restaurant transactions to about 7% during the pandemic, according to David Portalatin, food industry advisor at the NPD Group. In the month of May, third-party delivery orders rose 170% compared to the previous year, he said.Its a very challenging business to start with and for that reason, you had a lot of independent restaurants who said third-party delivery is not for us. Then, the world changed dramatically overnight, Portalatin said. There has been a dramatic shift, so everybody is participating. That is going to enable the third-party apps to sign up a whole lot of restaurants.WATCH: Uber whistleblower Susan Fowler details harassment, retaliation in new bookFor many restaurants, the price of partnering with third-party platforms is coming on top of the costs of reopening with reduced capacity and other safety restrictions imposed because of the virus, Portalatin said.Unfortunately, some restaurants are going to close, and some are going to evolve, he said.Uber has leaned on its food delivery business with COVID-19 cutting into all ride-share businesses. Ubers rides business slid 3% in the first quarter and dropped 80% in April compared with the same time last year. Bookings through its food delivery business, on the other hand, surged 54% in the first quarter.By acquiring Postmates, Uber not only gets the bigger share of the food delivery market it has long desired, but also shores itself up against further pandemic-related losses in its ride-hailing division.In our opinion, Uber finds itself with its back against the wall on the consolidation theme as the Grubhub deal fell apart on anti-trust concerns, and now must quickly look to acquire market share and added scale which makes the Postmates deal a smart strategic fit, analysts with Wedbush Securities wrote Monday.Postmates, a closely held private company, claims 600,000 food and restaurant merchants to choose from, which it claims is the largest selection in the U.S. The company says it has the ability to serve 80% of households across all 50 states.The boards of both companies have approved the transaction and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.Uber and Postmates are both based in San Francisco.Shares of Uber Technologies Inc. rose $1.84, or 6%, to close Monday at $32.52.AP Business Writers Alexandra Olson in New York and Dee-Ann Durbin in Ann Arbor, Michigan, contributed to this story."

(AP) — A statue of abolitionist Frederick Douglass was ripped from its base in Rochester on the anniversary of one of his most famous speeches, delivered in that city in 1852.Police said the statue of Douglass was taken on Sunday from Maplewood Park, a site along the Underground Railroad where Douglass and Harriet Tubman helped shuttle slaves to freedom.The statue was found at the brink of the Genesee River gorge about 50 feet (15 meters) from its pedestal, police said. There was damage to the base and a finger.In Rochester on July 5, 1852, Douglass gave the speech What to the Slave is the Fourth of July, in which he called the celebration of liberty a sham in a nation that enslaves and oppresses its Black citizens.MORE: What the future could hold for these symbols of the American pastTo a slave, Douglass said, Independence Day is a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.Carvin Eison, a leader of the project that brought the Douglass statue to the park, told the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle another statue will take its place because the damage is too significant.Is this some type of retaliation because of the national fever over confederate monuments right now?

But heres what does work,Betsy Mason,"['Jun 10, 2020']","This interview with psychologist Anthony Greenwald was republished with permission from Knowable Magazine. The original article was published on June 4, 2020. A quarter-century ago, social psychologist Anthony Greenwald of the University of Washington developed a test that exposed an uncomfortable aspect of the human mind: People have deep-seated biases of which they are completely unaware. And these hidden attitudes — known as implicit bias — influence the way we act toward each other, often with unintended discriminatory consequences.Since then, Greenwald and his main collaborators, Mahzarin Banaji and Brian Nosek, have used the implicit association test to measure how fast and accurately people associate different social groups with qualities like good and bad. They have developed versions of the test to measure things such as unconscious attitudes about race, gender stereotypes and bias against older people. Those tests have revealed just how pervasive implicit bias is. (Project Implicit offers public versions of the tests on its website here.)The researchers work has also shown how much implicit bias can shape social behavior and decision-making. Even people with the best intentions are influenced by these hidden attitudes, behaving in ways that can create disparities in hiring practices, student evaluations, law enforcement, criminal proceedings — pretty much anywhere people are making decisions that affect others. Such disparities can result from bias against certain groups, or favoritism toward other ones. Today, implicit bias is widely understood to be a cause of unintended discrimination that leads to racial, ethnic, socioeconomic and other inequalities.Discussions around the role of racism and implicit bias in the pattern of unequal treatment of racial minorities by law enforcement are intensifying following a roster of high-profile cases, most recently the killing of George Floyd. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis last month after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyds neck for nearly nine minutes.As awareness of implicit bias and its effects has increased, so has interest in mitigating it. But that is much harder to do than scientists expected, as Greenwald told an audience in Seattle in February at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Greenwald, coauthor of an overview on implicit bias research in the 2020 Annual Review of Psychology, spoke with Knowable Magazine about what does and doesnt work to counter the disparities that implicit bias can produce.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.How do you test for associations that people arent aware they have?The first implicit association test I created was one involving the names of flowers and insects, and words meaning things pleasant or unpleasant. You had to use left and right hands to classify them, tapping on a keyboard as they appeared on the screen. It was a very easy task when you had to use the right hand for both pleasant words and flower names, and the left hand for unpleasant words and insect names, because we typically think of flowers as pleasant and insects as unpleasant.But then the task is switched to force the opposite associations — one hand for insect names and pleasant words, and the other hand for flower names and unpleasant words. When I first tried that reversed form, my response time was about a third of a second slower compared to the first version. And in psychological work where youre asking people to respond rapidly, a third of a second is like an eternity, indicating that some mental processes are going on in this version of the test that are not going on in the other.Then I replaced the flowers and insects with first names of men and women that are easily classified as European American or African American. For me, giving the same response to pleasant words and African American names took an eternity. But when it was the European American names and pleasant words with one hand, and the African American names and the unpleasant words with the other hand, that was something I could zip through. And that was a surprise to me. I would have described myself at that point as someone who is lacking in biases or prejudices of a racial nature. I probably had some biases that I would confess to, but I actually didnt think I had that one.How widespread is implicit bias?That particular implicit bias, the one involving black-white race, shows up in about 70 percent to 75 percent of all Americans who try the test. It shows up more strongly in white Americans and Asian Americans than in mixed-race or African Americans. African Americans, youd think, might show just the reverse effect — that it would be easy for them to put African American together with pleasant and white American together with unpleasant. But no, African Americans show, on average, neither direction of bias on that task.Most people have multiple implicit biases they arent aware of. It is much more widespread than is generally assumed.Is implicit bias a factor in the pattern of police violence such as that seen in the killing of George Floyd on May 25, which sparked the ongoing protests across the country?The problems surfacing in the wake of George Floyds death include all forms of bias, ranging from implicit bias to structural bias built into the operation of police departments, courts and governments, to explicit, intended bias, to hate crime.The best theory of how implicit bias works is that it shapes conscious thought, which in turn guides judgments and decisions. The ABC News correspondent Pierre Thomas expressed this very well recently by saying, Black people feel like they are being treated as suspects first and citizens second. When a black person does something that is open to alternative interpretations, like reaching into a pocket or a cars glove compartment, many people — not just police officers — may think first that its possibly dangerous. But that wouldnt happen in viewing a white person do exactly the same action. The implications of conscious judgment being shaped in this way by an automatic, implicit process of which the perceiver is unaware can assume great importance in outcomes of interactions with police.Do the diversity or implicit bias training programs used by companies and institutions like Starbucks and the Oakland Police Department help reduce bias?Im at the moment very skeptical about most of whats offered under the label of implicit bias training, because the methods being used have not been tested scientifically to indicate that they are effective. And theyre using it without trying to assess whether the training they do is achieving the desired results.I see most implicit bias training as window dressing that looks good both internally to an organization and externally, as if youre concerned and trying to do something. But it can be deployed without actually achieving anything, which makes it in fact counterproductive. After 10 years of doing this stuff and nobody reporting data, I think the logical conclusion is that if it was working, we would have heard about it.Can you tell us about some of the approaches meant to reduce bias that havent worked?Ill give you several examples of techniques that have been tried with the assumption that they would achieve whats sometimes called debiasing or reducing implicit biases. One is exposure to counter-stereotypic examples, like seeing examples of admirable scientists or entertainers or others who are African American alongside examples of whites who are mass murderers. And that produces an immediate effect. You can show that it will actually affect a test result if you measure it within about a half-hour. But it was recently found that when people started to do these tests with longer delays, a day or more, any beneficial effect appears to be gone.Implicit bias is pervasiveHundreds of studies have revealed the workings of implicit bias in a wide range of settings. Here are a few examples that demonstrate how it can occur in just about any situation in which people make decisions that affect other people.In law enforcement: A study found that police in New York City stopped black and Hispanic pedestrians more often than white pedestrians, and a study in Oakland, California, found that black men were far more likely to be handcuffed, searched or arrested than anyone else when stopped by police.In the office: Hiring managers were less likely to invite an obese applicant for an interview, people see older workers as less valuable and bias against Arab-Muslim men influenced hiring decisions in Sweden.In the courtroom: Studies found that implicit bias against African Americans affects almost every step in the judicial system, from prosecutors deciding which cases to charge to judges handing down decisions.In the classroom: Public high school teachers in Sweden gave higher test scores to students with Swedish backgrounds than those with foreign ones, while American psychology students rated young male teachers higher than older men, as well as younger and older women.In the hospital: Doctors were more likely to offer a blood-clot-busting treatment to white patients with acute coronary disease than to black patients with the same symptoms, and nursing students showed a bias against overweight patients.In a pandemic? A study showed that when people feel especially vulnerable to infectious disease, their negative attitudes toward older adults may be heightened.—Betsy MasonOther strategies that havent been very effective include just encouraging people to have a strong intention not to allow themselves to be biased. Or trainers will suggest people do something that they may call thinking slow or pausing before making decisions. Another method that has been tried is meditation. And another strategy is making people aware that they have implicit biases or that implicit biases are pervasive in the population. All these may seem reasonable, but theres no empirical demonstration that they work.Its surprising to me that making people aware of their bias doesnt do anything to mitigate it. Why do you think that is?I think youre right, it is surprising. The mechanisms by which our brains form associations and acquire them from the cultural environment evolved over long periods of time, during which people lived in an environment that was consistent. They were not actually likely to acquire something that they would later have to unlearn, because the environment wasnt going to change. So there may have been no evolutionary pressure for the human brain to develop a method of unlearning the associations.I dont know why we have not succeeded in developing effective techniques to reduce implicit biases as they are measured by the implicit association test. Im not prepared to say that were never going to be able to do it, but I will say that people have been looking for a long time, ever since the test was introduced, which is over 20 years now, and this hasnt been solved yet.Is there anything that does work?I think that a lot can be achieved just by collecting data to document disparities that are occurring as a result of bias. And maybe an easy example is police operations, although it can be applied in many settings. Most police departments keep data on what we know as profiling, though they dont like to call it that. Its what happens in a traffic stop or a pedestrian stop — for example, the stop-and-frisk policy that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has taken heat for. The data of the New York City Police Department for stops of black and white pedestrians and drivers were analyzed, and it was very clear that there were disparities.Once you know where the problem is that has to be solved, its up to the administrators to figure out ways to understand why and how this is happening. Is it happening in just some parts of the city? Is it that the police are just operating more in Harlem than in the white neighborhoods?And once you know whats happening, the next step is what I call discretion elimination. This can be applied when people are making decisions that involve subjective judgment about a person. This could be police officers, employers making hiring or promotion decisions, doctors deciding on a patients treatment, or teachers making decisions about students performance. When those decisions are made with discretion, they are likely to result in unintended disparities. But when those decisions are made based on predetermined, objective criteria that are rigorously applied, they are much less likely to produce disparities.Is there evidence that discretion elimination works?What we know comes from the rare occasions in which the effects of discretion elimination have been recorded and reported. The classic example of this is when major symphony orchestras in the United States started using blind auditions in the 1970s. This was originally done because musicians thought that the auditions were biased in favor of graduates of certain schools like the Juilliard School. They werent concerned about gender discrimination.But as soon as auditions started to be made behind screens so the performer could not be seen, the share of women hired as instrumentalists in major symphony orchestras rose from around 10 percent or 20 percent before 1970 to about 40 percent. This has had a major impact on the rate at which women have become instrumentalists in major symphony orchestras.But these data-collection and discretion-elimination strategies arent commonly used?Not nearly as often as they could. For example, instructors can usually arrange to grade almost anything that a student does without knowing the identity of the student. In an electronic age when you dont learn to recognize peoples handwriting, instructors can grade essays without the students names on them. I used that approach when I was last grading undergraduates in courses. Its easy to use, but its often not used at all.And in many other circumstances it is possible to evaluate performance without knowing the identity of the person being evaluated. But employers and others rarely forgo the opportunity to know the identity of the person theyre evaluating.Can artificial intelligence play a role?People are starting to apply artificial intelligence to the task by mining historical records of past employment decisions. This is a way of taking the decisions that involve human discretion and putting them into the hands of a machine. The idea is to develop algorithms that identify promising applicants by matching their qualities to those of past applicants who turned out to be successful employees.I think its a great thing to try. But so far, efforts with AI have not succeeded, because the historical databases used to develop the algorithms to make these decisions turn out to be biased, too. They incorporate the biases of past decision-makers. One example is how biases affect facial-recognition technology, which inadvertently categorizes African American faces or Asian faces as criminal more often than white faces.READ MORE: Explore Knowables coronavirus coverageThis is a problem that computer scientists are trying to cope with, but some of the people in AI that I have spoken to seem not so optimistic that this will be at all easy to do. But I do think that ultimately — and it might take a while — the biases may be expunged more readily from AI decision algorithms than from human decision-making.Could more be done at the level of an individual company or department?To help prevent unintended discrimination, the leaders of organizations need to decide to track data to see where disparities are occurring. When they discover disparities, they need to try to make changes and then look at the next cycle of data to see if those changes are improving things.Obviously, its easier for them not to do those things. In some cases theres a cost to doing them. And they may think its like opening up Pandoras box if they look closely at the data. I think this is true of many police departments. Theyre bound to find things that theyd rather not see.This article originally appeared in Knowable Magazine, an independent journalistic endeavor from Annual Reviews. Sign up for the newsletter."

Federal authorities ruled last month that the rope had been hanging there since at least last October and was not a hate crime. Wallace has maintained the rope had been fashioned into a noose.Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? Trump tweeted. That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!The tweet came after Trump used a pair of Independence Day speeches to dig deeper into Americas divisions by accusing protesters who have pushed for racial justice of engaging in a merciless campaign to wipe out our history. The remarks served as a direct appeal to the Republican presidents political base, including many disaffected white voters, with less than four months to go before Election Day.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the presidents decision to wade into the Wallace case, saying in an interview on Fox News Channel that, The presidents merely pointing out that weve got to let facts come out before we jump to judgment.Wallace, an Alabama native, has taken an active role in the push for racial equality. He has worn a shirt saying I Cant Breathe, raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia and successfully lobbied for NASCARs Confederate flag ban.For more than 70 years, the flag was a common and complicated sight at NASCAR races. The series first tried to ban the Confederate flag five years ago but did nothing to enforce the order.While Trump claimed NASCARs ratings are down, they are actually up."

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/two-thirds-of-black-americans-dont-trust-the-police-to-treat-them-equally-most-white-americans-do,Two-thirds of black Americans dont trust the police to treat them equally. Most white Americans do.,Laura Santhanam,"['Jun 5, 2020']","Nearly half of black Americans have very little or no confidence that police officers in their community treat people with different skin colors the same, according to the latest PBS NewsHour-NPR-Marist poll. But overall, only 18 percent of Americans take that view — an illustration in itself that people of different races are living different realities in the United States. In the days since George Floyds death cracked open the country with demonstrations of people calling for the end of racism in policing, a third of all Americans — 35 percent — said they have a great deal of confidence that police officers in their communities treat black and white people equally, in this poll conducted June 2-3.Community trust in law enforcement has eroded somewhat over the past few years, as police-involved killings of black people have come to national attention, prompting pain and outrage. In December 2014, months after the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, a larger number — 41 percent of Americans — had a high degree of confidence in police.Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourBlack communities are often over-policed and over-profiled, which can even lead to fatality, as recent cases have shown us, said Dr. Michael Lindsey, who directs the McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research at New York University and has studied the effects of racism on mental health in black youth. Will an interaction with the police result in an outcome characterized by physical harm or unequal treatment by the court system? That is a real concern for black Americans.To Lindsey, the views expressed in this nationally representative poll of 1,062 U.S. adults correspond with a history of negative interactions and experiences between the police and blacks.A 2019 study showed that black men and boys face much higher risk of being killed by police in their lifetimes — 96 deaths out of 100,000 are at the hands of police — than do white men and boys, whose likelihood of death by cop is 39 out of 100,000. While this poll asked specifically about perceptions about policing of black and white people, reports of police violence in brown communities have also gained greater awareness in recent years.Protest or unlawfulness?Floyds death and some of his last words, I cant breathe — the same words spoken by Eric Garner, another black man whose death after being restrained by police was caught on video — ignited protests last week that have spread to dozens of cities across the country and show no signs of stopping. Some protests have exploded into intentional acts of property damage and ransacking of stores, and been marked by sometimes debilitating or deadly use of force by police.I had seen police brutality already, in real life and on [the TV], protester Devin Hinnant told PBS NewsHours Yamiche Alcindor in Washington. But something about hearing Floyd say, I cant breathe, made Hinnant feel he needed to know why that officer thought it was permissible to keep his knee on that mans neck, three minutes after he died.In the U.S., nearly two-thirds of Americans view the rallies and marches as mostly legitimate protests. That includes 87 percent of Democrats and 65 percent of independents. Just 28 percent of U.S. adults overall believe people are mostly acting unlawfully, including a higher proportion of Republicans —  59 percent. Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourThe protests have exposed generational fault lines on issues of race,with nearly three-quarters of Gen Z and millennials — those aged 18-39 — believing the protests are legitimate, compared to 60 percent of Generation X, 55 percent of baby boomers, and 48 percent of those over the age of 74. In many communities where people demonstrated, police used rubber bullets and tear gas to control crowds, in some cases severely injuring people. In one instance, photographer Linda Tirado lost sight in one eye after she said she was shot with a rubber bullet during a protest in Minneapolis. The citys police department disputed the claim.

Another 38 percent said police have mostly responded appropriately, including 41 percent of white Americans, 39 percent of Latinos and 32 percent of African Americans. Only 18 percent think police werent acting aggressively enough, including 20 percent of white respondents, 13 percent of Latinos, and 6 percent of African Americans.Trumps response to demonstrationsSixty-seven percent of Americans think President Donald Trump has mostly increased tensions since Floyds death, while 18 percent believe he has mostly decreased tensions.Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourOn May 29, Trump called protesters thugs and suggested he would respond with military force to control the situation, drawing criticism for stoking tensions.  These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I wont let that happen, Trump tweeted. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. In an unprecedented move, Twitter hid the tweet on his timeline behind a warning that said it violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence.READ MORE: Trumps tweet about rioters echoes 1960s Miami police chief"

Federal authorities ruled last month that the rope had been hanging there since at least last October and was not a hate crime. Wallace has maintained the rope had been fashioned into a noose and has said he was saddened by the despicable act of racism and hatred, and other Cup Series drivers rallied around him.Has BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? Trump tweeted. That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the presidents decision to wade into the Wallace case, saying that reporters were mischaracterizing the presidents tweet and were taking his comments about the Confederate flag out of context.The whole point of the tweet was to note the incident, the alleged hate crime that was not in fact a hate crime, she said.McEnany said the president rejects this notion that somehow NASCAR men and women, who go to these sporting events, are racists, and that the FBI report on the matter was an indictment of the medias rush to judgment.Wallace, an Alabama native, has taken an active role in the push for racial equality. He has worn a shirt saying I Cant Breathe, raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia and successfully lobbied for NASCARs Confederate flag ban.For more than 70 years, the flag was a common and complicated sight at NASCAR races. The series first tried to ban the Confederate flag five years ago but did nothing to enforce the order.While Trump claimed NASCARs ratings are down, they are actually up."

The creature, which predated dinosaurs and flying pterosaurs, was just shy of 4 inches (10 centimeters) tall, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Some of these things would have been quite cute animals, said study lead author Christian Kammerer, a paleontology researcher at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Looking like a small dinosaur that could fit in your hand, Kammerer mused that it would probably make a great pet. Of course, no humans were around when Kongonaphon was roaming the wild, jumping around with its strong hind legs and feeding on bugs with its peg-like teeth, Kammerer said. The name means tiny bug slayer.The fossils, dug up in Madagascar, date from 237 million years ago. Scientists figure the little guy was an adult because of growth rings in its bones, Kammerer said."

The book was originally set for release on July 28, but will now arrive on July 14.The revised date, announced Monday, came after a New York appellate court cleared the way for the books publication following a legal challenge by Trumps brother.The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the release date change.Robert Trump had sued Mary Trump to block publication of a book promoted to contain an insiders perspective of countless holiday meals, family interactions and family events.A judge last week left in place a restraint that blocked Mary Trump and any agent of hers from distributing the book, but the court made clear it was not considering Simon & Schuster to be covered by the ruling.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/uber-buys-postmates-in-2-65-billion-deal,Uber buys Postmates in $2.65 billion deal,Matt Ott,"['Jul 6, 2020']","SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) — Uber has widened its reach in the fiercely competitive delivery market by acquiring Postmates in a $2.65 billion all-stock deal, the company said Monday.The acquisition enables the ride-hailing giant to increase its delivery offerings at a time when the global pandemic has suppressed customers desire for rides while boosting home delivery needs. While Ubers meal delivery business, Uber Eats, has mostly focused on restaurants, Postmates delivers a wider array of goods including groceries, pharmacy items, alcoholic drinks and party supplies.The vision for us is to become an everyday service, said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, in a conference call with investors Monday. Postmates is a great step along that vision. Anyplace you want to go, anything you want delivered to your home, Uber is going to be there with you, and we think these everyday frequent interactions create a habit, create a connection with customers.WATCH: With food-delivery apps like Uber Eats, whos actually making money?Uber and its Uber Eats food-delivery division will gain ground against DoorDash, which controls about 44% of the U.S. meal delivery market. Thats compared with Uber Eats 23% share before the Postmates deal. Grubhub and its subsidiaries had just under 23% of the U.S. meal delivery market, according to May figures from Second Measure, a data analysis company. Postmates had about 8% of the market.We really believe that the market is much bigger than, lets say, the traditional delivery players, Khosrowshahi said. We look at groceries as a category, theres a lot of hot food being delivered, we look at essentials as a category that we are going to go after as well.Last month, Uber lost out in a bid for Grubhub, which would have made it the dominant U.S. food delivery service. But Amsterdam-based Just Eat Takeaway.com ended up nabbing Chicagos Grubhub in a $7.3 billion deal. Uber was reportedly seeking to team Grubhub with its Uber Eats business.The food delivery sector is undergoing a major consolidation this year and more is expected. The number of people using food delivery services is on the rise because of the coronavirus pandemic, but customers tend to jump around from service to service depending on where they can find the best deal.Some restaurants are already leaving the platforms, saying the commissions — which can top 30% — are too high.The Panda Express chain launched its own delivery service last month, saying delivery companies were making its meals too expensive for consumers. In March, some Washington restaurant and bar owners banded together to start their own delivery service, DC To-GoGo. It currently offers delivery from 18 establishments, and founder Josh Saltzman said its adding more each week.Smaller restaurants, however, lack the muscle to negotiate favorable terms with the third-party platforms, or the capacity to build out their own online ordering service. Many are turning to delivery, despite the costs, as a means surviving pandemic shutdown orders.For restaurants, the deal is not quite as good, said Stephen Beck, managing partner of management consultancy cg42. A consolidation of power, so to speak, and fewer options is not a good thing for the restaurant industry.Third-party delivery orders in the U.S. have risen from 2% of restaurant transactions to about 7% during the pandemic, according to David Portalatin, food industry advisor at the NPD Group. In the month of May, third-party delivery orders rose 170% compared to the previous year, he said.Its a very challenging business to start with and for that reason, you had a lot of independent restaurants who said third-party delivery is not for us. Then, the world changed dramatically overnight, Portalatin said. There has been a dramatic shift, so everybody is participating. That is going to enable the third-party apps to sign up a whole lot of restaurants.WATCH: Uber whistleblower Susan Fowler details harassment, retaliation in new bookFor many restaurants, the price of partnering with third-party platforms is coming on top of the costs of reopening with reduced capacity and other safety restrictions imposed because of the virus, Portalatin said.Unfortunately, some restaurants are going to close, and some are going to evolve, he said.Uber has leaned on its food delivery business with COVID-19 cutting into all ride-share businesses. Ubers rides business slid 3% in the first quarter and dropped 80% in April compared with the same time last year. Bookings through its food delivery business, on the other hand, surged 54% in the first quarter.By acquiring Postmates, Uber not only gets the bigger share of the food delivery market it has long desired, but also shores itself up against further pandemic-related losses in its ride-hailing division.In our opinion, Uber finds itself with its back against the wall on the consolidation theme as the Grubhub deal fell apart on anti-trust concerns, and now must quickly look to acquire market share and added scale which makes the Postmates deal a smart strategic fit, analysts with Wedbush Securities wrote Monday.Postmates, a closely held private company, claims 600,000 food and restaurant merchants to choose from, which it claims is the largest selection in the U.S. The company says it has the ability to serve 80% of households across all 50 states.The boards of both companies have approved the transaction and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.Uber and Postmates are both based in San Francisco.Shares of Uber Technologies Inc. rose $1.84, or 6%, to close Monday at $32.52.AP Business Writers Alexandra Olson in New York and Dee-Ann Durbin in Ann Arbor, Michigan, contributed to this story."

Beaches will reopen on Tuesday after they being closed over the weekend. But if we see crowding and people not following the public health rules, I will be forced to close the beaches again, the mayor warned.READ MORE: Unemployment woes a mounting strain on Trump in FloridaHospitalizations across the state have been ticking upward, with nearly 1,700 patients admitted in the past seven days compared with 1,200 the previous week. Five hospitals in the St. Petersburg area were out of intensive care unit beds, officials said.Miami-Dade said it has more than 1,600 coronavirus patients now in the hospital, more than double from two weeks ago. Miamis Baptist Hospital had only four of its 88 ICU beds available.If we continue to increase at the pace we have been, we wont have enough ventilators, enough rooms, said Dr. David De La Zerda, a respiratory specialist at Miamis Jackson Memorial Hospital.Officials in Texas likewise said hospitals are in danger of being overwhelmed. Hospitalizations statewide surged past 8,000 for the first time over the July Fourth weekend, a more than fourfold increase in the past month. Houston officials said intensive care units there have exceeded capacity.Along the border with Mexico, two severely ill patients were flown hundreds of miles north to Dallas and San Antonio because hospitals in the Rio Grande Valley were full.In Arizona, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 topped 3,200, a new high, and hospitals statewide were at 89% capacity. Confirmed cases surpassed 100,000, and more than half of those infected, or over 62,000, are under 44 years old, state health officials said.Around the country, health officials have warned that the surge is being driven in large part by younger people who are disregarding the social distancing rules and that they could easily spread the virus to older, more vulnerable people, such as their parents and grandparents.The coronavirus is blamed for over a half-million deaths worldwide, including more than 130,000 in the U.S., according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. The number of confirmed infections nationwide stood at 2.9 million, though the real number is believed to be 10 times higher.New cases per day nationwide have hit record levels well over 50,000. The daily count has surged more than 80% over the past two weeks, according to an Associated Press analysis.Average deaths per day have fallen over the same period from around 600 to about 510, in what experts say reflects advances in treatment and prevention as well as the large share of cases among young adults, who are more likely than older ones to survive COVID-19.But deaths are considered a lagging indicator — that is, it takes time for people to get sick and die. And experts are worried the downward trend in deaths could reverse itself.The trajectory of the virus following the July Fourth celebrations is being closely watched as states weigh whether to reopen schools in the coming months.If we dont control things now, were going to see things happening into mid-August to late August, said Dr. Cyrus Shahpar of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit organization that works to prevent epidemics.Meanwhile, three of the top U.S. medical organizations issued an open letter urging Americans to wear masks, social distance and wash hands often to help stop the worst public health crisis in generations.The American Medical Association, American Nurses Association and American Hospital Association issued the plea in the absence of a mask-wearing order from Washington and said steps taken early on that helped slow the spread of COVID-19 were too quickly abandoned.The White House again rejected calls for a nationwide order to wear face coverings. Appearing on Fox and Friends, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said that President Donald Trump sees the issue as a state matter.Were allowing our local governors and our local mayors to weigh in on that, he said.In New York City, once the most lethal hot spot in the country, nail salons and dog runs were allowed to reopen but indoor dining was postponed indefinitely.New York Gov.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/judge-orders-dakota-access-pipeline-shut-down-pending-environmental-review,Judge orders Dakota Access pipeline shut down pending environmental review,Dave Kolpack,"['Jul 6, 2020']","FARGO, N.D. (AP) — A judge on Monday ordered the Dakota Access pipeline shut down for additional environmental review more than three years after it began pumping oil — handing a victory to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and delivering a blow to President Donald Trumps efforts to weaken public health and environmental protections it views as obstacles to businesses.In a 24-page order, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., wrote that he was mindful of the disruption that shutting down the pipeline would cause, but that it must be done within 30 days. Pipeline owner Energy Transfer plans to ask a court to halt the order and will seek an expedited appeal, spokeswoman Vicki Granado said.The order comes after Boesberg said in April that a more extensive review was necessary than what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers already conducted and that he would consider whether the pipeline should be shuttered during the new assessment.The Court does not reach its decision with blithe disregard for the lives it will affect, Boasberg wrote Monday.Yet, given the seriousness of the Corps NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) error, the impossibility of a simple fix, the fact that Dakota Access did assume much of its economic risk knowingly, and the potential harm each day the pipeline operates, the Court is forced to conclude that the flow of oil must cease, he added.The findings may challenge the legal footing for the Trump administrations most momentous environmental rollbacks. Trump surrounded himself with industry leaders and workers in hard hats this January when he announced plans to overhaul the rules for enforcing NEPA.The Dakota Access pipeline was the subject of months of protests in 2016 and 2017, sometimes violent, during its construction near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border. The tribe pressed litigation against the pipeline even after it began carrying oil from North Dakota across South Dakota and Iowa and to a shipping point in Illinois in June 2017.The $3.8 billion, 1,172-mile (1,886 kilometer) pipeline crosses beneath the Missouri River, just north of the reservation. The tribe draws its water from the river and fears pollution.This pipeline should have never been built here. We told them that from the beginning, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Mike Faith said in a statement.Texas-based Energy Transfer contends proper procedures were followed in granting the original easement for the pipeline, Granado said.The economic implications of the Judges order are too big to ignore and we will do all we can to ensure its continued operation, she said. Billions of dollars in tax and royalty revenue will be lost by state, local and tribal governments in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Farmers will suffer as crude transportation will move to rail, displacing corn, wheat and soy crops that would normally be moved to market. Ironically, the counties along these rail lines will face increased environmental risks due to the increased amount of crude oil traveling by rail.Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, decried what he called a shocking ruling and noted that the pipeline is moving 570,000 barrels of Bakken oil a day.Before the coronavirus pandemic devastated the U.S. oil industry, daily oil production in North Dakota — the nations No. 2 oil producer behind Texas — was at a near-record 1.45 million barrels daily. The states output slipped to below 1 million barrels daily in May amid low energy prices and sparse demand.Permits for the project were originally rejected by the Obama administration, and the Army Corps of Engineers prepared to conduct a full environmental review. In February 2017, after Trump took office, the Corps scrapped the review and granted permits, concluding that running the pipeline under the Missouri River posed no significant environmental issues.The Corps said that opinion was validated after an additional year of review, as ordered by Boasberg, an Obama appointee, in 2017.Boasberg ruled then that the Corps largely complied with environmental law when permitting the pipeline but ordered more review because he said the agency did not adequately consider how an oil spill under the Missouri River might affect the Standing Rock Siouxs fishing and hunting rights, or whether it might disproportionately affect the tribal community.Associated Press writers James MacPherson in Bismarck, N.D., and Ellen Knickmeyer in Oklahoma City contributed to this story."

But heres what does work,Betsy Mason,"['Jun 10, 2020']","This interview with psychologist Anthony Greenwald was republished with permission from Knowable Magazine. The original article was published on June 4, 2020. A quarter-century ago, social psychologist Anthony Greenwald of the University of Washington developed a test that exposed an uncomfortable aspect of the human mind: People have deep-seated biases of which they are completely unaware. And these hidden attitudes — known as implicit bias — influence the way we act toward each other, often with unintended discriminatory consequences.Since then, Greenwald and his main collaborators, Mahzarin Banaji and Brian Nosek, have used the implicit association test to measure how fast and accurately people associate different social groups with qualities like good and bad. They have developed versions of the test to measure things such as unconscious attitudes about race, gender stereotypes and bias against older people. Those tests have revealed just how pervasive implicit bias is. (Project Implicit offers public versions of the tests on its website here.)The researchers work has also shown how much implicit bias can shape social behavior and decision-making. Even people with the best intentions are influenced by these hidden attitudes, behaving in ways that can create disparities in hiring practices, student evaluations, law enforcement, criminal proceedings — pretty much anywhere people are making decisions that affect others. Such disparities can result from bias against certain groups, or favoritism toward other ones. Today, implicit bias is widely understood to be a cause of unintended discrimination that leads to racial, ethnic, socioeconomic and other inequalities.Discussions around the role of racism and implicit bias in the pattern of unequal treatment of racial minorities by law enforcement are intensifying following a roster of high-profile cases, most recently the killing of George Floyd. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis last month after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyds neck for nearly nine minutes.As awareness of implicit bias and its effects has increased, so has interest in mitigating it. But that is much harder to do than scientists expected, as Greenwald told an audience in Seattle in February at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Greenwald, coauthor of an overview on implicit bias research in the 2020 Annual Review of Psychology, spoke with Knowable Magazine about what does and doesnt work to counter the disparities that implicit bias can produce.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.How do you test for associations that people arent aware they have?The first implicit association test I created was one involving the names of flowers and insects, and words meaning things pleasant or unpleasant. You had to use left and right hands to classify them, tapping on a keyboard as they appeared on the screen. It was a very easy task when you had to use the right hand for both pleasant words and flower names, and the left hand for unpleasant words and insect names, because we typically think of flowers as pleasant and insects as unpleasant.But then the task is switched to force the opposite associations — one hand for insect names and pleasant words, and the other hand for flower names and unpleasant words. When I first tried that reversed form, my response time was about a third of a second slower compared to the first version. And in psychological work where youre asking people to respond rapidly, a third of a second is like an eternity, indicating that some mental processes are going on in this version of the test that are not going on in the other.Then I replaced the flowers and insects with first names of men and women that are easily classified as European American or African American. For me, giving the same response to pleasant words and African American names took an eternity. But when it was the European American names and pleasant words with one hand, and the African American names and the unpleasant words with the other hand, that was something I could zip through. And that was a surprise to me. I would have described myself at that point as someone who is lacking in biases or prejudices of a racial nature. I probably had some biases that I would confess to, but I actually didnt think I had that one.How widespread is implicit bias?That particular implicit bias, the one involving black-white race, shows up in about 70 percent to 75 percent of all Americans who try the test. It shows up more strongly in white Americans and Asian Americans than in mixed-race or African Americans. African Americans, youd think, might show just the reverse effect — that it would be easy for them to put African American together with pleasant and white American together with unpleasant. But no, African Americans show, on average, neither direction of bias on that task.Most people have multiple implicit biases they arent aware of. It is much more widespread than is generally assumed.Is implicit bias a factor in the pattern of police violence such as that seen in the killing of George Floyd on May 25, which sparked the ongoing protests across the country?The problems surfacing in the wake of George Floyds death include all forms of bias, ranging from implicit bias to structural bias built into the operation of police departments, courts and governments, to explicit, intended bias, to hate crime.The best theory of how implicit bias works is that it shapes conscious thought, which in turn guides judgments and decisions. The ABC News correspondent Pierre Thomas expressed this very well recently by saying, Black people feel like they are being treated as suspects first and citizens second. When a black person does something that is open to alternative interpretations, like reaching into a pocket or a cars glove compartment, many people — not just police officers — may think first that its possibly dangerous. But that wouldnt happen in viewing a white person do exactly the same action. The implications of conscious judgment being shaped in this way by an automatic, implicit process of which the perceiver is unaware can assume great importance in outcomes of interactions with police.Do the diversity or implicit bias training programs used by companies and institutions like Starbucks and the Oakland Police Department help reduce bias?Im at the moment very skeptical about most of whats offered under the label of implicit bias training, because the methods being used have not been tested scientifically to indicate that they are effective. And theyre using it without trying to assess whether the training they do is achieving the desired results.I see most implicit bias training as window dressing that looks good both internally to an organization and externally, as if youre concerned and trying to do something. But it can be deployed without actually achieving anything, which makes it in fact counterproductive. After 10 years of doing this stuff and nobody reporting data, I think the logical conclusion is that if it was working, we would have heard about it.Can you tell us about some of the approaches meant to reduce bias that havent worked?Ill give you several examples of techniques that have been tried with the assumption that they would achieve whats sometimes called debiasing or reducing implicit biases. One is exposure to counter-stereotypic examples, like seeing examples of admirable scientists or entertainers or others who are African American alongside examples of whites who are mass murderers. And that produces an immediate effect. You can show that it will actually affect a test result if you measure it within about a half-hour. But it was recently found that when people started to do these tests with longer delays, a day or more, any beneficial effect appears to be gone.Implicit bias is pervasiveHundreds of studies have revealed the workings of implicit bias in a wide range of settings. Here are a few examples that demonstrate how it can occur in just about any situation in which people make decisions that affect other people.In law enforcement: A study found that police in New York City stopped black and Hispanic pedestrians more often than white pedestrians, and a study in Oakland, California, found that black men were far more likely to be handcuffed, searched or arrested than anyone else when stopped by police.In the office: Hiring managers were less likely to invite an obese applicant for an interview, people see older workers as less valuable and bias against Arab-Muslim men influenced hiring decisions in Sweden.In the courtroom: Studies found that implicit bias against African Americans affects almost every step in the judicial system, from prosecutors deciding which cases to charge to judges handing down decisions.In the classroom: Public high school teachers in Sweden gave higher test scores to students with Swedish backgrounds than those with foreign ones, while American psychology students rated young male teachers higher than older men, as well as younger and older women.In the hospital: Doctors were more likely to offer a blood-clot-busting treatment to white patients with acute coronary disease than to black patients with the same symptoms, and nursing students showed a bias against overweight patients.In a pandemic? A study showed that when people feel especially vulnerable to infectious disease, their negative attitudes toward older adults may be heightened.—Betsy MasonOther strategies that havent been very effective include just encouraging people to have a strong intention not to allow themselves to be biased. Or trainers will suggest people do something that they may call thinking slow or pausing before making decisions. Another method that has been tried is meditation. And another strategy is making people aware that they have implicit biases or that implicit biases are pervasive in the population. All these may seem reasonable, but theres no empirical demonstration that they work.Its surprising to me that making people aware of their bias doesnt do anything to mitigate it. Why do you think that is?I think youre right, it is surprising. The mechanisms by which our brains form associations and acquire them from the cultural environment evolved over long periods of time, during which people lived in an environment that was consistent. They were not actually likely to acquire something that they would later have to unlearn, because the environment wasnt going to change. So there may have been no evolutionary pressure for the human brain to develop a method of unlearning the associations.I dont know why we have not succeeded in developing effective techniques to reduce implicit biases as they are measured by the implicit association test. Im not prepared to say that were never going to be able to do it, but I will say that people have been looking for a long time, ever since the test was introduced, which is over 20 years now, and this hasnt been solved yet.Is there anything that does work?I think that a lot can be achieved just by collecting data to document disparities that are occurring as a result of bias. And maybe an easy example is police operations, although it can be applied in many settings. Most police departments keep data on what we know as profiling, though they dont like to call it that. Its what happens in a traffic stop or a pedestrian stop — for example, the stop-and-frisk policy that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has taken heat for. The data of the New York City Police Department for stops of black and white pedestrians and drivers were analyzed, and it was very clear that there were disparities.Once you know where the problem is that has to be solved, its up to the administrators to figure out ways to understand why and how this is happening. Is it happening in just some parts of the city? Is it that the police are just operating more in Harlem than in the white neighborhoods?And once you know whats happening, the next step is what I call discretion elimination. This can be applied when people are making decisions that involve subjective judgment about a person. This could be police officers, employers making hiring or promotion decisions, doctors deciding on a patients treatment, or teachers making decisions about students performance. When those decisions are made with discretion, they are likely to result in unintended disparities. But when those decisions are made based on predetermined, objective criteria that are rigorously applied, they are much less likely to produce disparities.Is there evidence that discretion elimination works?What we know comes from the rare occasions in which the effects of discretion elimination have been recorded and reported. The classic example of this is when major symphony orchestras in the United States started using blind auditions in the 1970s. This was originally done because musicians thought that the auditions were biased in favor of graduates of certain schools like the Juilliard School. They werent concerned about gender discrimination.But as soon as auditions started to be made behind screens so the performer could not be seen, the share of women hired as instrumentalists in major symphony orchestras rose from around 10 percent or 20 percent before 1970 to about 40 percent. This has had a major impact on the rate at which women have become instrumentalists in major symphony orchestras.But these data-collection and discretion-elimination strategies arent commonly used?Not nearly as often as they could. For example, instructors can usually arrange to grade almost anything that a student does without knowing the identity of the student. In an electronic age when you dont learn to recognize peoples handwriting, instructors can grade essays without the students names on them. I used that approach when I was last grading undergraduates in courses. Its easy to use, but its often not used at all.And in many other circumstances it is possible to evaluate performance without knowing the identity of the person being evaluated. But employers and others rarely forgo the opportunity to know the identity of the person theyre evaluating.Can artificial intelligence play a role?People are starting to apply artificial intelligence to the task by mining historical records of past employment decisions. This is a way of taking the decisions that involve human discretion and putting them into the hands of a machine. The idea is to develop algorithms that identify promising applicants by matching their qualities to those of past applicants who turned out to be successful employees.I think its a great thing to try. But so far, efforts with AI have not succeeded, because the historical databases used to develop the algorithms to make these decisions turn out to be biased, too. They incorporate the biases of past decision-makers. One example is how biases affect facial-recognition technology, which inadvertently categorizes African American faces or Asian faces as criminal more often than white faces.READ MORE: Explore Knowables coronavirus coverageThis is a problem that computer scientists are trying to cope with, but some of the people in AI that I have spoken to seem not so optimistic that this will be at all easy to do. But I do think that ultimately — and it might take a while — the biases may be expunged more readily from AI decision algorithms than from human decision-making.Could more be done at the level of an individual company or department?To help prevent unintended discrimination, the leaders of organizations need to decide to track data to see where disparities are occurring. When they discover disparities, they need to try to make changes and then look at the next cycle of data to see if those changes are improving things.Obviously, its easier for them not to do those things. In some cases theres a cost to doing them. And they may think its like opening up Pandoras box if they look closely at the data. I think this is true of many police departments. Theyre bound to find things that theyd rather not see.This article originally appeared in Knowable Magazine, an independent journalistic endeavor from Annual Reviews. Sign up for the newsletter."

It takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court that a state may instruct electors that they have no ground for reversing the vote of millions of its citizens. That direction accords with the Constitution — as well as with the trust of a Nation that here, We the People rule.The justices had scheduled arguments for the spring so they could resolve the issue before the election, rather than amid a potential political crisis after the country votes.When the court heard arguments by telephone in May because of the coronavirus outbreak, justices invoked fears of bribery and chaos if electors could cast their ballots regardless of the popular vote outcome in their states.The issue arose in lawsuits filed by three Hillary Clinton electors in Washington state and one in Colorado who refused to vote for her despite her popular vote win in both states. In so doing, they hoped to persuade enough electors in states won by Donald Trump to choose someone else and deny Trump the presidency.MORE: What Supreme Court decision on Louisiana law means for U.S. abortion rightsThe federal appeals court in Denver ruled that electors can vote as they please, rejecting arguments that they must choose the popular-vote winner. In Washington, the state Supreme Court upheld a $1,000 fine against the three electors and rejected their claims.In all, there were 10 faithless electors in 2016, including a fourth in Washington, a Democratic elector in Hawaii and two Republican electors in Texas.

Federal authorities ruled last month that the rope had been hanging there since at least last October and was not a hate crime. Wallace has maintained the rope had been fashioned into a noose.Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? Trump tweeted. That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!The tweet came after Trump used a pair of Independence Day speeches to dig deeper into Americas divisions by accusing protesters who have pushed for racial justice of engaging in a merciless campaign to wipe out our history. The remarks served as a direct appeal to the Republican presidents political base, including many disaffected white voters, with less than four months to go before Election Day.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the presidents decision to wade into the Wallace case, saying in an interview on Fox News Channel that, The presidents merely pointing out that weve got to let facts come out before we jump to judgment.Wallace, an Alabama native, has taken an active role in the push for racial equality. He has worn a shirt saying I Cant Breathe, raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia and successfully lobbied for NASCARs Confederate flag ban.For more than 70 years, the flag was a common and complicated sight at NASCAR races. The series first tried to ban the Confederate flag five years ago but did nothing to enforce the order.While Trump claimed NASCARs ratings are down, they are actually up."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-live-answering-your-questions-on-race-in-the-workplace,5 ways to approach racial equity at work,Courtney Vinopal,"['Jun 5, 2020']","The death of George Floyd and the protests that have followed sparked a national dialogue about race in America. For many, discussions about race and the reality of living in America as a black person happen daily. But many households, communities and workplaces are having these conversations for the first time. How can employers and colleagues better support employees of color? What is the most productive way to talk about race in the workplace?Watch this discussion in the video player above.Raël Nelson James, the director of diversity, equity and inclusion at The Bridgespan Group and the PBS NewsHours Stephanie Sy took viewer questions on navigating discussions of race at work.The traumatic events of the past few weeks can be a catalyst to kick off discussions about race, diversity and inclusion in the workplace, James said, but cautioned that employees should be sensitive about how they approach it.  James stressed that allyship is not a destination, and employers will have to put in the work to learn and think deeply about how they can reform their workplace dynamics to better advocate for and uplift diverse talent within their workplaces, as well as commit to pursuing racial equity. Here is some advice from James about how employees can start to think and act on  this in the coming days and weeks.  READ MORE: What we know about George Floyds death in Minneapolis police custodyWhat do employees of color want to see in their workplaces?While workplaces may see the events of the past week as a prime opportunity for rethinking their approach toward race, James cautioned against pursuing too much, too quickly. If your company or your organization is new to multiracial dialogue, I would posit that this week, emotions are too raw to kick off that effort, she said.What folks, I think, need this week is psychologically safe spaces to process this without putting a burden on people of color to be educators, James said, noting that asking black employees to educate, process and absorb the emotions of their white colleagues during a moment of immense social unrest is akin to assigning them a second job. While building multiracial dialogue in the workplace is a valuable goal, James said, Its not something to just dive into this week when tensions and emotions are running high. Multiracial dialogue is a complex, nuanced thing that takes skill to do well, she added, saying that companies should start thinking about hiring a professional who can guide their office to a path toward racial equity before pursuing these efforts on their own. How can white supervisors advocate and make space for their brown and black staff?James said that white supervisors checking in on employees of color should be cautious of asking questions such as are you okay? While it may be well-intentioned, No one is okay, and it comes across as tone-deaf, James said of this approach, particularly during this moment of national crisis. What folks, I think, need this week is psychologically safe spaces to process this without putting a burden on people of color to be educators.Model some of the vulnerability and some of the empathy that one would hope is extended to you as well, James said, noting that while this is a collective moment of grieving and of sadness for black people, it should be a moment of grieving, sadness and outrage for all people.James added that managers and supervisors should think about how they can give their employees of color space to process the traumatic events — in both the short and long-term — as they move forward. On the short-term, for example, they can be more flexible with granting employees leave. In the long run, they should think about how they can root out and eliminate the manifestations of structural racism in their office by supporting and promoting employees of color, diversifying their boards, and bringing in experts specializing in diversity, equity and inclusion to help them in doing so. How can you advocate for racial equity if not in a position of leadership?James said that employees who are hoping to see their office pursue racial equity should seek out colleagues who will identify themselves as allies and work on this alongside them. At James organization, The Bridgespan Group, they did something similar after the death of Michael Brown in 2014. It was a similarly difficult time where black folks and other people of color were navigating this sort of grief and wondering if anyone else was having a similar experience in the workplace, James said. After gathering together, James said, Bridgespan formed a racial equity working group to help shepherd their commitment to racial equity.She encouraged employees seeking this in the workplace to create a space where others can raise their hand, identify themselves as allies, identify themselves as other people who want to work on this with you.Are there ways employees can engage beyond their social media accounts?Asked about the recent surge of posts circulating on social media in support of the black community, James said that while she understands people may be processing this moment in different ways, the best way to support black colleagues and friends is to reach out in person to those with whom you already share an authentic relationship. Intellectually I understand why the deaths of George Floyd and Tony McDade and Breonna Taylor have created a crescendo in this moment, James said of the recent flood of interest in Black Lives Matter and other movements against police brutality on social media. But she said that reaching out to a colleague simply because they are black and especially if you dont have a preexisting rapport with them is unhelpful and its draining during a time when we are already exhausted.Instead, James said, you can reach out to comfort and support black colleagues with whom you feel close. Alternatively, she said you should ask yourself, have I done the things … to build relationships with the black people in my community at my job, do I have that kind of trustful relationship? If you havent, consider making a personal commitment to donate money or take a class on inclusive management, for example. James said that making a commitment to do better by colleagues of color will mean more for this community in the long run than emails, texts, or other performative displays of support such as social media posts. Why color blindness misses the markWhile it may be tempting to shift the focus away from race in an effort to boost unity at a moment like this, James cautioned against doing so. Color blindness fundamentally misses the mark by erasing something thats fundamental to peoples identity and peoples self-love, said James, noting that being black is a centering and central part of her identity and she wants people to appreciate her because of that, not in spite of it.  She added that black Americans have spent their lives learning about whiteness and what it means to be white in the U.S., but said that white people might be hesitant to reciprocate that. Instead of pushing the issue away, James recommended that workplace employees lean into the kind of discomfort it might take to become an ally to marginalized communities and devote themselves to pursuing that path.

On the video he recorded of the woman, he sounds calm and appears to keep a safe distance from her.District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement on Monday that his office had charged Amy Cooper with falsely reporting the confrontation, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of a year behind bars. She was ordered to appear in court on Oct. 14.Coopers attorney, Robert Barnes, said Cooper would fight the charge. His client, he said, has already lost her livelihood and her public life. Now some demand her freedom?Reached by phone on Monday, Christian Cooper said he had no reaction or comment.After the backlash, Amy Cooper released an apology through a public relations service, saying she reacted emotionally and made false assumptions about his intentions.WATCH: Reasons for hope amid Americas racial unrestHe had every right to request that I leash my dog in an area where it was required, she said in the written statement. I am well aware of the pain that misassumptions and insensitive statements about race cause and would never have imagined that I would be involved in the type of incident that occurred with Chris.Amy Coopers 911 call was seen by many as a stark example of everyday racism and fueled outrage in the period leading up to the street protests sparked by the police custody death of George Floyd. It also inspired New York state lawmakers in June to pass a law that makes it easier under civil rights law to sue an individual who calls a police officer on someone without reason because of their background, including race and national origin.The new law, which the governor also signed last month, holds an individual who makes such 911 calls liable for injunctive relief, damages, or any other appropriate relief in a civil lawsuit. Cooper was charged under an existing false-report law thats been long on the books and doesnt reference race.The confrontation began early one morning when Christian Cooper said he noticed Amy Cooper had let her cocker spaniel off its leash against the rules in the Ramble, a secluded section of Central Park popular with birdwatchers.In the video posted on social media, he claimed the dog was tearing through the plantings and told her she should go to another part of the park. When she refused, he pulled out dog treats, causing her to scream at him to not come near her dog.Amy Cooper also warned him she would summon police unless he stopped recording.Im going to tell them theres an African American man threatening my life, Amy Cooper is heard saying in the video as she pulls down her face mask and struggles to control her dog.Please call the cops, Christian Cooper says.Theres an African American man, Im in Central Park, he is recording me and threatening myself and my dog. … Please send the cops immediately! she says during the call before he stops recording.Police say by the time they responded, they were both gone.___Associated Press writer Michael R.

Noem didnt wear a mask on the plane and chatted with the president as the flight returned to Washington, D.C., according to her spokesperson, Maggie Seidel.Noem had tested negative for COVID-19 shortly before welcoming Trump to South Dakota on Friday, a day after she had interacted with Guilfoyle.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/two-thirds-of-black-americans-dont-trust-the-police-to-treat-them-equally-most-white-americans-do,Two-thirds of black Americans dont trust the police to treat them equally. Most white Americans do.,Laura Santhanam,"['Jun 5, 2020']","Nearly half of black Americans have very little or no confidence that police officers in their community treat people with different skin colors the same, according to the latest PBS NewsHour-NPR-Marist poll. But overall, only 18 percent of Americans take that view — an illustration in itself that people of different races are living different realities in the United States. In the days since George Floyds death cracked open the country with demonstrations of people calling for the end of racism in policing, a third of all Americans — 35 percent — said they have a great deal of confidence that police officers in their communities treat black and white people equally, in this poll conducted June 2-3.Community trust in law enforcement has eroded somewhat over the past few years, as police-involved killings of black people have come to national attention, prompting pain and outrage. In December 2014, months after the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, a larger number — 41 percent of Americans — had a high degree of confidence in police.Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourBlack communities are often over-policed and over-profiled, which can even lead to fatality, as recent cases have shown us, said Dr. Michael Lindsey, who directs the McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research at New York University and has studied the effects of racism on mental health in black youth. Will an interaction with the police result in an outcome characterized by physical harm or unequal treatment by the court system? That is a real concern for black Americans.To Lindsey, the views expressed in this nationally representative poll of 1,062 U.S. adults correspond with a history of negative interactions and experiences between the police and blacks.A 2019 study showed that black men and boys face much higher risk of being killed by police in their lifetimes — 96 deaths out of 100,000 are at the hands of police — than do white men and boys, whose likelihood of death by cop is 39 out of 100,000. While this poll asked specifically about perceptions about policing of black and white people, reports of police violence in brown communities have also gained greater awareness in recent years.Protest or unlawfulness?Floyds death and some of his last words, I cant breathe — the same words spoken by Eric Garner, another black man whose death after being restrained by police was caught on video — ignited protests last week that have spread to dozens of cities across the country and show no signs of stopping. Some protests have exploded into intentional acts of property damage and ransacking of stores, and been marked by sometimes debilitating or deadly use of force by police.I had seen police brutality already, in real life and on [the TV], protester Devin Hinnant told PBS NewsHours Yamiche Alcindor in Washington. But something about hearing Floyd say, I cant breathe, made Hinnant feel he needed to know why that officer thought it was permissible to keep his knee on that mans neck, three minutes after he died.In the U.S., nearly two-thirds of Americans view the rallies and marches as mostly legitimate protests. That includes 87 percent of Democrats and 65 percent of independents. Just 28 percent of U.S. adults overall believe people are mostly acting unlawfully, including a higher proportion of Republicans —  59 percent. Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourThe protests have exposed generational fault lines on issues of race,with nearly three-quarters of Gen Z and millennials — those aged 18-39 — believing the protests are legitimate, compared to 60 percent of Generation X, 55 percent of baby boomers, and 48 percent of those over the age of 74. In many communities where people demonstrated, police used rubber bullets and tear gas to control crowds, in some cases severely injuring people. In one instance, photographer Linda Tirado lost sight in one eye after she said she was shot with a rubber bullet during a protest in Minneapolis. The citys police department disputed the claim.

Another 38 percent said police have mostly responded appropriately, including 41 percent of white Americans, 39 percent of Latinos and 32 percent of African Americans. Only 18 percent think police werent acting aggressively enough, including 20 percent of white respondents, 13 percent of Latinos, and 6 percent of African Americans.Trumps response to demonstrationsSixty-seven percent of Americans think President Donald Trump has mostly increased tensions since Floyds death, while 18 percent believe he has mostly decreased tensions.Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourOn May 29, Trump called protesters thugs and suggested he would respond with military force to control the situation, drawing criticism for stoking tensions.  These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I wont let that happen, Trump tweeted. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. In an unprecedented move, Twitter hid the tweet on his timeline behind a warning that said it violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence.READ MORE: Trumps tweet about rioters echoes 1960s Miami police chief"

Federal authorities ruled last month that the rope had been hanging there since at least last October and was not a hate crime. Wallace has maintained the rope had been fashioned into a noose and has said he was saddened by the despicable act of racism and hatred, and other Cup Series drivers rallied around him.Has BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? Trump tweeted. That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the presidents decision to wade into the Wallace case, saying that reporters were mischaracterizing the presidents tweet and were taking his comments about the Confederate flag out of context.The whole point of the tweet was to note the incident, the alleged hate crime that was not in fact a hate crime, she said.McEnany said the president rejects this notion that somehow NASCAR men and women, who go to these sporting events, are racists, and that the FBI report on the matter was an indictment of the medias rush to judgment.Wallace, an Alabama native, has taken an active role in the push for racial equality. He has worn a shirt saying I Cant Breathe, raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia and successfully lobbied for NASCARs Confederate flag ban.For more than 70 years, the flag was a common and complicated sight at NASCAR races. The series first tried to ban the Confederate flag five years ago but did nothing to enforce the order.While Trump claimed NASCARs ratings are down, they are actually up."

The creature, which predated dinosaurs and flying pterosaurs, was just shy of 4 inches (10 centimeters) tall, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Some of these things would have been quite cute animals, said study lead author Christian Kammerer, a paleontology researcher at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Looking like a small dinosaur that could fit in your hand, Kammerer mused that it would probably make a great pet. Of course, no humans were around when Kongonaphon was roaming the wild, jumping around with its strong hind legs and feeding on bugs with its peg-like teeth, Kammerer said. The name means tiny bug slayer.The fossils, dug up in Madagascar, date from 237 million years ago. Scientists figure the little guy was an adult because of growth rings in its bones, Kammerer said."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-live-answering-your-questions-on-race-in-the-workplace,5 ways to approach racial equity at work,Courtney Vinopal,"['Jun 5, 2020']","The death of George Floyd and the protests that have followed sparked a national dialogue about race in America. For many, discussions about race and the reality of living in America as a black person happen daily. But many households, communities and workplaces are having these conversations for the first time. How can employers and colleagues better support employees of color? What is the most productive way to talk about race in the workplace?Watch this discussion in the video player above.Raël Nelson James, the director of diversity, equity and inclusion at The Bridgespan Group and the PBS NewsHours Stephanie Sy took viewer questions on navigating discussions of race at work.The traumatic events of the past few weeks can be a catalyst to kick off discussions about race, diversity and inclusion in the workplace, James said, but cautioned that employees should be sensitive about how they approach it.  James stressed that allyship is not a destination, and employers will have to put in the work to learn and think deeply about how they can reform their workplace dynamics to better advocate for and uplift diverse talent within their workplaces, as well as commit to pursuing racial equity. Here is some advice from James about how employees can start to think and act on  this in the coming days and weeks.  READ MORE: What we know about George Floyds death in Minneapolis police custodyWhat do employees of color want to see in their workplaces?While workplaces may see the events of the past week as a prime opportunity for rethinking their approach toward race, James cautioned against pursuing too much, too quickly. If your company or your organization is new to multiracial dialogue, I would posit that this week, emotions are too raw to kick off that effort, she said.What folks, I think, need this week is psychologically safe spaces to process this without putting a burden on people of color to be educators, James said, noting that asking black employees to educate, process and absorb the emotions of their white colleagues during a moment of immense social unrest is akin to assigning them a second job. While building multiracial dialogue in the workplace is a valuable goal, James said, Its not something to just dive into this week when tensions and emotions are running high. Multiracial dialogue is a complex, nuanced thing that takes skill to do well, she added, saying that companies should start thinking about hiring a professional who can guide their office to a path toward racial equity before pursuing these efforts on their own. How can white supervisors advocate and make space for their brown and black staff?James said that white supervisors checking in on employees of color should be cautious of asking questions such as are you okay? While it may be well-intentioned, No one is okay, and it comes across as tone-deaf, James said of this approach, particularly during this moment of national crisis. What folks, I think, need this week is psychologically safe spaces to process this without putting a burden on people of color to be educators.Model some of the vulnerability and some of the empathy that one would hope is extended to you as well, James said, noting that while this is a collective moment of grieving and of sadness for black people, it should be a moment of grieving, sadness and outrage for all people.James added that managers and supervisors should think about how they can give their employees of color space to process the traumatic events — in both the short and long-term — as they move forward. On the short-term, for example, they can be more flexible with granting employees leave. In the long run, they should think about how they can root out and eliminate the manifestations of structural racism in their office by supporting and promoting employees of color, diversifying their boards, and bringing in experts specializing in diversity, equity and inclusion to help them in doing so. How can you advocate for racial equity if not in a position of leadership?James said that employees who are hoping to see their office pursue racial equity should seek out colleagues who will identify themselves as allies and work on this alongside them. At James organization, The Bridgespan Group, they did something similar after the death of Michael Brown in 2014. It was a similarly difficult time where black folks and other people of color were navigating this sort of grief and wondering if anyone else was having a similar experience in the workplace, James said. After gathering together, James said, Bridgespan formed a racial equity working group to help shepherd their commitment to racial equity.She encouraged employees seeking this in the workplace to create a space where others can raise their hand, identify themselves as allies, identify themselves as other people who want to work on this with you.Are there ways employees can engage beyond their social media accounts?Asked about the recent surge of posts circulating on social media in support of the black community, James said that while she understands people may be processing this moment in different ways, the best way to support black colleagues and friends is to reach out in person to those with whom you already share an authentic relationship. Intellectually I understand why the deaths of George Floyd and Tony McDade and Breonna Taylor have created a crescendo in this moment, James said of the recent flood of interest in Black Lives Matter and other movements against police brutality on social media. But she said that reaching out to a colleague simply because they are black and especially if you dont have a preexisting rapport with them is unhelpful and its draining during a time when we are already exhausted.Instead, James said, you can reach out to comfort and support black colleagues with whom you feel close. Alternatively, she said you should ask yourself, have I done the things … to build relationships with the black people in my community at my job, do I have that kind of trustful relationship? If you havent, consider making a personal commitment to donate money or take a class on inclusive management, for example. James said that making a commitment to do better by colleagues of color will mean more for this community in the long run than emails, texts, or other performative displays of support such as social media posts. Why color blindness misses the markWhile it may be tempting to shift the focus away from race in an effort to boost unity at a moment like this, James cautioned against doing so. Color blindness fundamentally misses the mark by erasing something thats fundamental to peoples identity and peoples self-love, said James, noting that being black is a centering and central part of her identity and she wants people to appreciate her because of that, not in spite of it.  She added that black Americans have spent their lives learning about whiteness and what it means to be white in the U.S., but said that white people might be hesitant to reciprocate that. Instead of pushing the issue away, James recommended that workplace employees lean into the kind of discomfort it might take to become an ally to marginalized communities and devote themselves to pursuing that path.

The book was originally set for release on July 28, but will now arrive on July 14.The revised date, announced Monday, came after a New York appellate court cleared the way for the books publication following a legal challenge by Trumps brother.The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the release date change.Robert Trump had sued Mary Trump to block publication of a book promoted to contain an insiders perspective of countless holiday meals, family interactions and family events.A judge last week left in place a restraint that blocked Mary Trump and any agent of hers from distributing the book, but the court made clear it was not considering Simon & Schuster to be covered by the ruling.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/uber-buys-postmates-in-2-65-billion-deal,Uber buys Postmates in $2.65 billion deal,Matt Ott,"['Jul 6, 2020']","SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) — Uber has widened its reach in the fiercely competitive delivery market by acquiring Postmates in a $2.65 billion all-stock deal, the company said Monday.The acquisition enables the ride-hailing giant to increase its delivery offerings at a time when the global pandemic has suppressed customers desire for rides while boosting home delivery needs. While Ubers meal delivery business, Uber Eats, has mostly focused on restaurants, Postmates delivers a wider array of goods including groceries, pharmacy items, alcoholic drinks and party supplies.The vision for us is to become an everyday service, said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, in a conference call with investors Monday. Postmates is a great step along that vision. Anyplace you want to go, anything you want delivered to your home, Uber is going to be there with you, and we think these everyday frequent interactions create a habit, create a connection with customers.WATCH: With food-delivery apps like Uber Eats, whos actually making money?Uber and its Uber Eats food-delivery division will gain ground against DoorDash, which controls about 44% of the U.S. meal delivery market. Thats compared with Uber Eats 23% share before the Postmates deal. Grubhub and its subsidiaries had just under 23% of the U.S. meal delivery market, according to May figures from Second Measure, a data analysis company. Postmates had about 8% of the market.We really believe that the market is much bigger than, lets say, the traditional delivery players, Khosrowshahi said. We look at groceries as a category, theres a lot of hot food being delivered, we look at essentials as a category that we are going to go after as well.Last month, Uber lost out in a bid for Grubhub, which would have made it the dominant U.S. food delivery service. But Amsterdam-based Just Eat Takeaway.com ended up nabbing Chicagos Grubhub in a $7.3 billion deal. Uber was reportedly seeking to team Grubhub with its Uber Eats business.The food delivery sector is undergoing a major consolidation this year and more is expected. The number of people using food delivery services is on the rise because of the coronavirus pandemic, but customers tend to jump around from service to service depending on where they can find the best deal.Some restaurants are already leaving the platforms, saying the commissions — which can top 30% — are too high.The Panda Express chain launched its own delivery service last month, saying delivery companies were making its meals too expensive for consumers. In March, some Washington restaurant and bar owners banded together to start their own delivery service, DC To-GoGo. It currently offers delivery from 18 establishments, and founder Josh Saltzman said its adding more each week.Smaller restaurants, however, lack the muscle to negotiate favorable terms with the third-party platforms, or the capacity to build out their own online ordering service. Many are turning to delivery, despite the costs, as a means surviving pandemic shutdown orders.For restaurants, the deal is not quite as good, said Stephen Beck, managing partner of management consultancy cg42. A consolidation of power, so to speak, and fewer options is not a good thing for the restaurant industry.Third-party delivery orders in the U.S. have risen from 2% of restaurant transactions to about 7% during the pandemic, according to David Portalatin, food industry advisor at the NPD Group. In the month of May, third-party delivery orders rose 170% compared to the previous year, he said.Its a very challenging business to start with and for that reason, you had a lot of independent restaurants who said third-party delivery is not for us. Then, the world changed dramatically overnight, Portalatin said. There has been a dramatic shift, so everybody is participating. That is going to enable the third-party apps to sign up a whole lot of restaurants.WATCH: Uber whistleblower Susan Fowler details harassment, retaliation in new bookFor many restaurants, the price of partnering with third-party platforms is coming on top of the costs of reopening with reduced capacity and other safety restrictions imposed because of the virus, Portalatin said.Unfortunately, some restaurants are going to close, and some are going to evolve, he said.Uber has leaned on its food delivery business with COVID-19 cutting into all ride-share businesses. Ubers rides business slid 3% in the first quarter and dropped 80% in April compared with the same time last year. Bookings through its food delivery business, on the other hand, surged 54% in the first quarter.By acquiring Postmates, Uber not only gets the bigger share of the food delivery market it has long desired, but also shores itself up against further pandemic-related losses in its ride-hailing division.In our opinion, Uber finds itself with its back against the wall on the consolidation theme as the Grubhub deal fell apart on anti-trust concerns, and now must quickly look to acquire market share and added scale which makes the Postmates deal a smart strategic fit, analysts with Wedbush Securities wrote Monday.Postmates, a closely held private company, claims 600,000 food and restaurant merchants to choose from, which it claims is the largest selection in the U.S. The company says it has the ability to serve 80% of households across all 50 states.The boards of both companies have approved the transaction and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.Uber and Postmates are both based in San Francisco.Shares of Uber Technologies Inc. rose $1.84, or 6%, to close Monday at $32.52.AP Business Writers Alexandra Olson in New York and Dee-Ann Durbin in Ann Arbor, Michigan, contributed to this story."

And these hidden attitudes — known as implicit bias — influence the way we act toward each other, often with unintended discriminatory consequences.Since then, Greenwald and his main collaborators, Mahzarin Banaji and Brian Nosek, have used the implicit association test to measure how fast and accurately people associate different social groups with qualities like good and bad. They have developed versions of the test to measure things such as unconscious attitudes about race, gender stereotypes and bias against older people. Those tests have revealed just how pervasive implicit bias is. (Project Implicit offers public versions of the tests on its website here.)The researchers work has also shown how much implicit bias can shape social behavior and decision-making. Even people with the best intentions are influenced by these hidden attitudes, behaving in ways that can create disparities in hiring practices, student evaluations, law enforcement, criminal proceedings — pretty much anywhere people are making decisions that affect others. Such disparities can result from bias against certain groups, or favoritism toward other ones. Today, implicit bias is widely understood to be a cause of unintended discrimination that leads to racial, ethnic, socioeconomic and other inequalities.Discussions around the role of racism and implicit bias in the pattern of unequal treatment of racial minorities by law enforcement are intensifying following a roster of high-profile cases, most recently the killing of George Floyd. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis last month after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyds neck for nearly nine minutes.As awareness of implicit bias and its effects has increased, so has interest in mitigating it. But that is much harder to do than scientists expected, as Greenwald told an audience in Seattle in February at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Greenwald, coauthor of an overview on implicit bias research in the 2020 Annual Review of Psychology, spoke with Knowable Magazine about what does and doesnt work to counter the disparities that implicit bias can produce.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.How do you test for associations that people arent aware they have?The first implicit association test I created was one involving the names of flowers and insects, and words meaning things pleasant or unpleasant. You had to use left and right hands to classify them, tapping on a keyboard as they appeared on the screen. It was a very easy task when you had to use the right hand for both pleasant words and flower names, and the left hand for unpleasant words and insect names, because we typically think of flowers as pleasant and insects as unpleasant.But then the task is switched to force the opposite associations — one hand for insect names and pleasant words, and the other hand for flower names and unpleasant words. When I first tried that reversed form, my response time was about a third of a second slower compared to the first version. And in psychological work where youre asking people to respond rapidly, a third of a second is like an eternity, indicating that some mental processes are going on in this version of the test that are not going on in the other.Then I replaced the flowers and insects with first names of men and women that are easily classified as European American or African American. For me, giving the same response to pleasant words and African American names took an eternity. But when it was the European American names and pleasant words with one hand, and the African American names and the unpleasant words with the other hand, that was something I could zip through. And that was a surprise to me. I would have described myself at that point as someone who is lacking in biases or prejudices of a racial nature. I probably had some biases that I would confess to, but I actually didnt think I had that one.How widespread is implicit bias?That particular implicit bias, the one involving black-white race, shows up in about 70 percent to 75 percent of all Americans who try the test. It shows up more strongly in white Americans and Asian Americans than in mixed-race or African Americans. African Americans, youd think, might show just the reverse effect — that it would be easy for them to put African American together with pleasant and white American together with unpleasant. But no, African Americans show, on average, neither direction of bias on that task.Most people have multiple implicit biases they arent aware of. It is much more widespread than is generally assumed.Is implicit bias a factor in the pattern of police violence such as that seen in the killing of George Floyd on May 25, which sparked the ongoing protests across the country?The problems surfacing in the wake of George Floyds death include all forms of bias, ranging from implicit bias to structural bias built into the operation of police departments, courts and governments, to explicit, intended bias, to hate crime.The best theory of how implicit bias works is that it shapes conscious thought, which in turn guides judgments and decisions. The ABC News correspondent Pierre Thomas expressed this very well recently by saying, Black people feel like they are being treated as suspects first and citizens second. When a black person does something that is open to alternative interpretations, like reaching into a pocket or a cars glove compartment, many people — not just police officers — may think first that its possibly dangerous. But that wouldnt happen in viewing a white person do exactly the same action. The implications of conscious judgment being shaped in this way by an automatic, implicit process of which the perceiver is unaware can assume great importance in outcomes of interactions with police.Do the diversity or implicit bias training programs used by companies and institutions like Starbucks and the Oakland Police Department help reduce bias?Im at the moment very skeptical about most of whats offered under the label of implicit bias training, because the methods being used have not been tested scientifically to indicate that they are effective. And theyre using it without trying to assess whether the training they do is achieving the desired results.I see most implicit bias training as window dressing that looks good both internally to an organization and externally, as if youre concerned and trying to do something. But it can be deployed without actually achieving anything, which makes it in fact counterproductive. After 10 years of doing this stuff and nobody reporting data, I think the logical conclusion is that if it was working, we would have heard about it.Can you tell us about some of the approaches meant to reduce bias that havent worked?Ill give you several examples of techniques that have been tried with the assumption that they would achieve whats sometimes called debiasing or reducing implicit biases. One is exposure to counter-stereotypic examples, like seeing examples of admirable scientists or entertainers or others who are African American alongside examples of whites who are mass murderers. And that produces an immediate effect. You can show that it will actually affect a test result if you measure it within about a half-hour. But it was recently found that when people started to do these tests with longer delays, a day or more, any beneficial effect appears to be gone.Implicit bias is pervasiveHundreds of studies have revealed the workings of implicit bias in a wide range of settings. Here are a few examples that demonstrate how it can occur in just about any situation in which people make decisions that affect other people.In law enforcement: A study found that police in New York City stopped black and Hispanic pedestrians more often than white pedestrians, and a study in Oakland, California, found that black men were far more likely to be handcuffed, searched or arrested than anyone else when stopped by police.In the office: Hiring managers were less likely to invite an obese applicant for an interview, people see older workers as less valuable and bias against Arab-Muslim men influenced hiring decisions in Sweden.In the courtroom: Studies found that implicit bias against African Americans affects almost every step in the judicial system, from prosecutors deciding which cases to charge to judges handing down decisions.In the classroom: Public high school teachers in Sweden gave higher test scores to students with Swedish backgrounds than those with foreign ones, while American psychology students rated young male teachers higher than older men, as well as younger and older women.In the hospital: Doctors were more likely to offer a blood-clot-busting treatment to white patients with acute coronary disease than to black patients with the same symptoms, and nursing students showed a bias against overweight patients.In a pandemic? A study showed that when people feel especially vulnerable to infectious disease, their negative attitudes toward older adults may be heightened.—Betsy MasonOther strategies that havent been very effective include just encouraging people to have a strong intention not to allow themselves to be biased. Or trainers will suggest people do something that they may call thinking slow or pausing before making decisions. Another method that has been tried is meditation. And another strategy is making people aware that they have implicit biases or that implicit biases are pervasive in the population. All these may seem reasonable, but theres no empirical demonstration that they work.Its surprising to me that making people aware of their bias doesnt do anything to mitigate it. Why do you think that is?I think youre right, it is surprising. The mechanisms by which our brains form associations and acquire them from the cultural environment evolved over long periods of time, during which people lived in an environment that was consistent. They were not actually likely to acquire something that they would later have to unlearn, because the environment wasnt going to change. So there may have been no evolutionary pressure for the human brain to develop a method of unlearning the associations.I dont know why we have not succeeded in developing effective techniques to reduce implicit biases as they are measured by the implicit association test. Im not prepared to say that were never going to be able to do it, but I will say that people have been looking for a long time, ever since the test was introduced, which is over 20 years now, and this hasnt been solved yet.Is there anything that does work?I think that a lot can be achieved just by collecting data to document disparities that are occurring as a result of bias. And maybe an easy example is police operations, although it can be applied in many settings. Most police departments keep data on what we know as profiling, though they dont like to call it that. Its what happens in a traffic stop or a pedestrian stop — for example, the stop-and-frisk policy that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has taken heat for. The data of the New York City Police Department for stops of black and white pedestrians and drivers were analyzed, and it was very clear that there were disparities.Once you know where the problem is that has to be solved, its up to the administrators to figure out ways to understand why and how this is happening. Is it happening in just some parts of the city? Is it that the police are just operating more in Harlem than in the white neighborhoods?And once you know whats happening, the next step is what I call discretion elimination. This can be applied when people are making decisions that involve subjective judgment about a person. This could be police officers, employers making hiring or promotion decisions, doctors deciding on a patients treatment, or teachers making decisions about students performance. When those decisions are made with discretion, they are likely to result in unintended disparities. But when those decisions are made based on predetermined, objective criteria that are rigorously applied, they are much less likely to produce disparities.Is there evidence that discretion elimination works?What we know comes from the rare occasions in which the effects of discretion elimination have been recorded and reported. The classic example of this is when major symphony orchestras in the United States started using blind auditions in the 1970s. This was originally done because musicians thought that the auditions were biased in favor of graduates of certain schools like the Juilliard School. They werent concerned about gender discrimination.But as soon as auditions started to be made behind screens so the performer could not be seen, the share of women hired as instrumentalists in major symphony orchestras rose from around 10 percent or 20 percent before 1970 to about 40 percent. This has had a major impact on the rate at which women have become instrumentalists in major symphony orchestras.But these data-collection and discretion-elimination strategies arent commonly used?Not nearly as often as they could. For example, instructors can usually arrange to grade almost anything that a student does without knowing the identity of the student. In an electronic age when you dont learn to recognize peoples handwriting, instructors can grade essays without the students names on them. I used that approach when I was last grading undergraduates in courses. Its easy to use, but its often not used at all.And in many other circumstances it is possible to evaluate performance without knowing the identity of the person being evaluated. But employers and others rarely forgo the opportunity to know the identity of the person theyre evaluating.Can artificial intelligence play a role?People are starting to apply artificial intelligence to the task by mining historical records of past employment decisions. This is a way of taking the decisions that involve human discretion and putting them into the hands of a machine. The idea is to develop algorithms that identify promising applicants by matching their qualities to those of past applicants who turned out to be successful employees.I think its a great thing to try. But so far, efforts with AI have not succeeded, because the historical databases used to develop the algorithms to make these decisions turn out to be biased, too. They incorporate the biases of past decision-makers. One example is how biases affect facial-recognition technology, which inadvertently categorizes African American faces or Asian faces as criminal more often than white faces.READ MORE: Explore Knowables coronavirus coverageThis is a problem that computer scientists are trying to cope with, but some of the people in AI that I have spoken to seem not so optimistic that this will be at all easy to do. But I do think that ultimately — and it might take a while — the biases may be expunged more readily from AI decision algorithms than from human decision-making.Could more be done at the level of an individual company or department?To help prevent unintended discrimination, the leaders of organizations need to decide to track data to see where disparities are occurring. When they discover disparities, they need to try to make changes and then look at the next cycle of data to see if those changes are improving things.Obviously, its easier for them not to do those things. In some cases theres a cost to doing them. And they may think its like opening up Pandoras box if they look closely at the data. I think this is true of many police departments. Theyre bound to find things that theyd rather not see.This article originally appeared in Knowable Magazine, an independent journalistic endeavor from Annual Reviews. Sign up for the newsletter."

The trip also marks the president's first campaign rally in a political battleground state and second mega-event since his hiatus from the trail due to the coronavirus pandemic. The president's reelection campaign announced Sunday that the rally will take place at Portsmouth International Airport at 8 p.m. ET. According to a statement released by the Trump campaign, the outdoor event will feature ""ample access to hand sanitizer"" and all attendees ""will be provided a face mask that they are strongly encouraged to wear."" Trump campaign officials tell CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga that all attendees will also be required to pass a temperature check upon entry. Though the event will technically take place on federal land at the former site of Pease Air Force Base, the Trump campaign has coordinated with Governor Chris Sununu's office and state officials ahead of Saturday's event.There have been over 5,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases in New Hampshire, and more than 380 deaths, according to the state's Department of Public Health. Nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire residents disapprove of Mr. Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a University of New Hampshire survey released last month. In a survey of New Hampshire voters released last month, Mr. Trump trails Joe Biden. The presumptive Democratic nominee led the GOP incumbent 49% to 42% among registered voters, according to the Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll. Mr. Trump last visited the Granite State on February 10, which was the eve of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, for a crowded indoor rally in downtown Manchester. But it was in 2011 that then-real estate mogul Donald Trump first dropped into Portsmouth International Airport in a Trump-emblazoned black helicopter to explore a GOP primary bid, after pushing false rumors that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.The upcoming rally, just a few short miles from the Maine border, is expected to also draw supporters from the neighboring state. In 2016, Mr. Trump won Maine's 2nd congressional district, making him the first Republican to score Maine electoral votes since George H. W. Bush in 1988. The Republican mayor of the Democratic-leaning city of Portsmouth, Rick Becksted, said he learned of the rally Sunday evening while watching the news and receiving email inquiries.      Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxFROM THE CANDIDATESJOE BIDENJoe Biden continues to chart a rhetorical contrast on Mr. Trump's declared ""war"" on cancel culture and the debate over racial equality in the country, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. The Biden campaign said it was clear after Friday's presidential address at Mount Rushmore that the ""divisive president … doesn't give a damn about anything but his own gain."" In his Independence Day message, Biden cited notes of history on slavery and the Civil War as examples of work still needed to fulfill the country's founding promise ""that all men [and women] are created equal."" The former vice president didn't appear anywhere publicly for the Fourth of July as his focus has been hyper cognizant on social distancing guidelines from both federal officials and officials in his home state of Delaware. Monday was another day without public appearances for Biden but his campaign announced their senior Florida ground game team, adding to the handful of battleground states where the Democrats have a physical staffing presence.  VEEPSTAKESELIZABETH WARRENTrail Markers                2020 Daily Trail Markers: Trump campaign schedules next rally to be outdoors                              Daily Trail Markers: Trump, Biden spar over jobs report as cases spike                              Daily Trail Markers: Wisconsin court won't expedite voter purge case                              Daily Trail Markers: Biden responds to Russian bounty intel reports                              2020 Daily Trail Markers: Supreme Court affirms abortion protections                          More in Trail Markers            Senator Elizabeth Warren is asking the country's largest food and beverage processors and farm operators to disclose what they're doing to protect their workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic, according to CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. In a letter to companies including Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz sent last week and released Monday, Warren along with Senators Jeff Merkley and Cory Booker wrote that failing to take substantial virus protection measures could have impacts beyond the health of their workers. ""Outbreaks in your facilities could threaten the broader food supply chain by further exacerbating existing labor shortages and reducing plant processing capacity,"" they wrote. ""Given the increasing consolidation of your industry, both producers and consumers could be left with limited alternatives, negatively affecting market opportunities for farmers and creating potential shortages for consumers."" In June, Warren and Booker had raised similar concerns about worker safety at meatpacking plants.KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMSAtlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced Monday on Twitter that she has tested positive for COVID-19. Bottoms later said in an interview on MSNBC that the news came as a shock to her, as she had only experienced mild allergy-like symptoms. ""This is startling for me because we've been so very careful. But certainly we are not immune."" Bottoms said in the interview and added, ""This is just a lesson to everyone. That you have to take every single symptom seriously as I see this growing list of symptoms. We can't assume that it's seasonal allergies. We can't assume that a mild cough, I get a seasonal allergies. We all need to be tested."" CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry reports that members of Bottoms' team have begun contact tracing measures. The mayor recently met with the family members of Secoriea Turner, a young girl who was murdered in Atlanta over the weekend.  Bottoms will quarantine in her home for the next two weeks.LEGAL MATTERSSUPREME DECISIONSThe Supreme Court on Monday said states can require presidential electors to cast their votes for their party's candidate that won the state's popular vote, upholding state laws that punish so-called ""faithless electors"" who break their pledge and vote for a candidate other than the one who won the state's popular vote. CBS News digital reporter Melissa Quinn says the high court was unanimous in its ruling that the laws at issue in a pair of disputes from Washington and Colorado are constitutional. The decision from the Supreme Court comes just months ahead of the November general election, when voters will head to the polls to elect a president and vice president. ""The Constitution's text and the nation's history both support allowing a state to enforce an elector's pledge to support his party's nominee — and the state voters' choice — for president,"" Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court. Justice Sonia Sotomayor took no part in the decision of the dispute involving faithless electors in Colorado. The justices heard arguments in the disputes, the last of its term, via teleconference, as the court was forced to alter the format of arguments because of the coronavirus pandemic.STATE-BY-STATENEVADAThe Nevada State Democratic Party marked the launch of their coordinated campaign with ""virtual ice cream socials"" across the state over the weekend, with ""more than two dozen new field organizers"" hired in the past month as they race to ramp up their operation ahead of the general election, reports CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Biden's team in Nevada has also brought on another new top aide, Elizabeth Warren campaign alum Kevin Liao, to serve as their Nevada communications director. ""We've built up a strong field program across 2016 and 2018 and, this year, we're taking nothing for granted,"" Shelby Wiltz, head of the state party's coordinated campaign, said in a statement. GOVERNOR'S MANSION UTAHIn Utah's Republican gubernatorial primary, Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox has beaten former Governor and U.S. ambassador to China Jon Huntsman. The race was June 30, but due to the close initial margin and counting of mail ballots, the Associated Press called the race Monday afternoon. Cox captured 36.4% of the vote, while Huntsman had 34.6%. Cox is the favorite against Democrat law Professor Chris Harrison in November, since there hasn't been a Democratic governor since 1985.   CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGEIN THE HOUSENEW JERSEYOriginally slated for June 2 but postponed due to coronavirus, 12 House districts and one Senate seat will be on the ballot Tuesday in New Jersey. Some of the races to watch include a Kennedy, a progressive challenger to a Democrat incumbent, and a heated Republican primary for a targeted seat. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro has more below on some of the races to watch.New Jersey's 2ndAmy Kennedy and political science professor Brigid Callahan Harrison are leading the Democratic primary to challenge Congressman Jeff Van Drew, who notably switched parties during the impeachment process. Kennedy, an educator and wife of former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy, has the endorsements of Governor Phil Murphy and the Atlantic County Democratic Party, where one-third of voters reside. Harrison originally filed to primary Van Drew the week he voted against impeachment, and has been backed by six county chairs as well as Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker.  Another candidate in the running is Will Cunningham, a former congressional staffer who ran against Van Drew in the 2018 primary. New Jersey's 3rdDemocrat freshman Andy Kim is among the top targets for national Republicans, as Mr. Trump won this district by 6 points in 2016 before Kim narrowly flipped it in the midterms. In his district is a competitive GOP primary between engineer & lawyer David Richter and Kate Gibbs, a former elected official in Burlington County. Richter has loaned his campaign more money, but Gibbs has gotten support from outside groups such as the Defending Main Street PAC. New Jersey's 5thCongressman Josh Gottheimer is facing a challenge from the left with local Councilwoman Arati Kreibich. Kreibich has recently been backed by progressive stalwarts like Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders. Gottheimer, who is in his second term, has the backing of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Representatives Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey.  Gottheimer is currently co-chair of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, and Kreibich's campaign has looked to tie Gottheimer's focus on bipartisanship to the Republican party and Wall Street. Internal Gottheimer polls have him with a safe lead (62% to 21%), while Kreibich's internal polling shows her within a two-point margin after respondents were given more information about her platform and messaging. Both campaigns are prepared for results to come in later than Tuesday night due to the influx of mail-in ballots.AND IN CASE YOU MISSED IT…CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar and Nicole Sganga join CBSN to talk about their reporting in California and Maine for CBS News COVID Chronicles.

Cox is the favorite against Democrat law Professor Chris Harrison in November, since there hasn't been a Democratic governor since 1985.   CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGEIN THE HOUSENEW JERSEYOriginally slated for June 2 but postponed due to coronavirus, 12 House districts and one Senate seat will be on the ballot Tuesday in New Jersey. Some of the races to watch include a Kennedy, a progressive challenger to a Democrat incumbent, and a heated Republican primary for a targeted seat. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro has more below on some of the races to watch.New Jersey's 2ndAmy Kennedy and political science professor Brigid Callahan Harrison are leading the Democratic primary to challenge Congressman Jeff Van Drew, who notably switched parties during the impeachment process. Kennedy, an educator and wife of former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy, has the endorsements of Governor Phil Murphy and the Atlantic County Democratic Party, where one-third of voters reside. Harrison originally filed to primary Van Drew the week he voted against impeachment, and has been backed by six county chairs as well as Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker.  Another candidate in the running is Will Cunningham, a former congressional staffer who ran against Van Drew in the 2018 primary. New Jersey's 3rdDemocrat freshman Andy Kim is among the top targets for national Republicans, as Mr. Trump won this district by 6 points in 2016 before Kim narrowly flipped it in the midterms. In his district is a competitive GOP primary between engineer & lawyer David Richter and Kate Gibbs, a former elected official in Burlington County. Richter has loaned his campaign more money, but Gibbs has gotten support from outside groups such as the Defending Main Street PAC. New Jersey's 5thCongressman Josh Gottheimer is facing a challenge from the left with local Councilwoman Arati Kreibich. Kreibich has recently been backed by progressive stalwarts like Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders. Gottheimer, who is in his second term, has the backing of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Representatives Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey.  Gottheimer is currently co-chair of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, and Kreibich's campaign has looked to tie Gottheimer's focus on bipartisanship to the Republican party and Wall Street. Internal Gottheimer polls have him with a safe lead (62% to 21%), while Kreibich's internal polling shows her within a two-point margin after respondents were given more information about her platform and messaging. Both campaigns are prepared for results to come in later than Tuesday night due to the influx of mail-in ballots.AND IN CASE YOU MISSED IT…CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar and Nicole Sganga join CBSN to talk about their reporting in California and Maine for CBS News COVID Chronicles.

Only four people of the 145 known infected individuals in the U.S. have survived, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Naegleria fowleri   is contacted when contaminated water enters through a person's nose, and is found in warm freshwater such as lakers, rivers and hot springs, according to the CDC.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cell-phone-data-show-consumers-avoiding-stores-as-covid-19-cases-surge/,"Phone data show consumers avoiding stores, restaurants as COVID surges",['Megan Cerullo'],"['July 2, 2020']","Cell phone data that track users' whereabouts show that fewer Americans are patronizing local businesses and chain stores as COVID-19 cases surge in states like Arizona, California and Florida — a worrying sign that may dash hopes for a swift economic rebound after consumer spending dropped sharply at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The phone data show millions of American consumers basically voting with their feet. Traffic at retail and food establishments ticked upward for most of April and May as businesses reopened, emboldening people to venture outside, but it has started to drop again since mid-June, marking one of the first periods of deceleration since city and state lockdowns began. That's according to SafeGraph, which married anonymized cell phone data with its database of business listings and points of interest.Foot traffic reached its lowest point on April 14, when it was down 55% from January levels. Since that nadir, the nation has started easing up and there's been a gradual recovery. ""Now, that's starting to flatline and turn reverse course in the past few days,"" SafeGraph spokesperson Nick Singh said of the latest consumer patterns. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxData from restaurant reservation service OpenTable show a similar trend, with the level of sit-down dining patrons picking up in early June but dropping again at the end of the month.Experts say the data illustrate some of the economic consequences of reopening too quickly and how early efforts to jumpstart the economy appear to be backfiring. Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has for months warned the business community of these risks. Coronavirus: The Race To Respond                Stars remember Broadway actor Nick Cordero: ""What a light""                              Miami shuts down indoor dining and gyms as virus cases rise                              Atlanta mayor tests positive for coronavirus                              ICE says foreign students can't take online-only fall classes                              Only 40% of Harvard undergrads will return to campus this fall                          More in Coronavirus: The Race To Respond            ""If we end up coming out too soon and that results in substantial spread of the virus, that will be counterproductive in re-opening of economy. The more we box the virus in, the more space there is for us in society,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch in May.""A grand opening surge""It's not all linked to an uptick in COVID cases, though. Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said customers' brief returns to stores would have been short-lived no matter what. ""People were cooped up for a month, so as soon as they heard bars opening, they jumped back out,"" he said. ""It was a grand opening surge, and those things don't have legs."" SafeGraph measured the number of visits to millions of retail chains and mom-and-pop businesses from March through June and compared them to the number of visits during a baseline week in mid-January before the pandemic had taken hold in the U.S.On June 28, restaurants, stores and other establishments saw a 20% decrease in visitors compared to January. A week earlier, on June 21, they had been only 18% less busy. This recent dip in traffic is even more acute in states suffering from the sharpest increases in coronavirus cases as a result of governments relaxing social distancing measures and allowing businesses to reopen more fully — by permitting, for example, restaurants to seat customers inside.  Retail stores face uphill battle during pande...01:57Case numbers in Florida rose most sharply between June 22 and June 27, when they hit 9,019 new cases in one day, compared to 3,200 new cases on June 22, according to Johns Hopkins University's coronavirus case tracker. Bars in Florida saw a 5% percent drop in foot traffic over the same period, according to the SafeGraph data. Sit-down restaurants in the Sunshine State saw similar declines in patron counts. These data show what pubic health experts and economists alike have tried to impress upon the public — that containing the virus and reviving the economy go hand-in-hand. A separate set of credit card transaction data also show that residents in states with newly rising coronavirus case counts are making fewer visits to restaurants, stores and other places where people typically spend money.A report from Facteus, which collects anonymized data from financial companies and card issuers, shows that year-over-year growth in overall spending started decelerating on June 25 in the U.S.. Retail spending growth dropped 14 percentage points between June 21 and June 28, marking the biggest negative change in week-to-week growth during the recovery so far. ""The retail space has been trending very high over the past couple of months driven by e-commerce, but we have seen a deceleration in that. It's gone back down to prior levels to where it was in the April and early-May time frame,"" said Steve Shaw, a spokesperson for Facteus. Average retail spending growth was up 28% in mid-May, as a result, in part, of Americans receiving stimulus checks directed by the CARES Act. ""Obviously, they were not spending it on entertainment and travel, so they were using it in the retail space,"" Shaw added.The deceleration is likely due to a combination of factors, including consumers' stimulus checks running out as well as additional unemployment aid ending. It also appears to be tied to the virus' resurgence in states like Arizona, Florida and Texas, where infection rates are spiking again after they abandoned social distancing precautions. Growth rates in all three states are trending lower than the broader economy, according to Facteus' analysis, perhaps because many residents have become fearful of going out. Texas lags by about 4% compared to the rest of the U.S., while Florida lags by 5% and Arizona by 7%. ""It's only one week, but it's certainly something that we are going to be focusing on and paying attention to,"" Shaw said.Cohen of Columbia Business School predicts a ""pretty wild ride downward"" for the foreseeable future. ""If you ask me when I think this is going to be 'over,' I think it's way out in 2022 when the health issue has been solved or is under control and the extraordinary economic damage this virus has created has begun to ameliorate,"" he said. "

That same year, he received the Pioneer Award from the Academy of Country Music.In the 1990s Daniels softened some of his lyrics from his earlier days when he often was embroiled in controversy.In ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia,"" a 1979 song about a fiddling duel between the devil and a whippersnapper named Johnny, Daniels originally called the devil a ""son of a bitch,"" but changed it to ""son of a gun.""In his 1980 hit ""Long Haired Country Boy,"" he used to sing about being ""stoned in the morning"" and ""drunk in the afternoon."" Daniels changed it to ""I get up in the morning. I get down in the afternoon.""""I guess I've mellowed in my old age,"" Daniels said in 1998.Otherwise, though, he rarely backed down from in-your-face lyrics.His ""Simple Man"" in 1990 suggested lynching drug dealers and using child abusers as alligator bait.His ""In America"" in 1980 told this country's enemies to ""go straight to hell.""Such tough talk earned him guest spots on ""Politically Incorrect,"" the G. Gordon Liddy radio show and on C-Span taking comments from viewers.""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"" was No. 1 on the country charts in 1979 and No. 3 on the pop charts. It was voted single of the year by the Country Music Association.In the climactic verse, Daniels sang:""The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.""He laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet.""Johnny said, `Devil just come on back if you ever want to try again.""I told you once you son of a gun, I'm the best that's ever been.""He hosted regular Volunteer Jam concerts in Nashville in which the performers usually were not announced in advance.

King, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eugene Fodor and Woody Herman.Daniels, a native of Wilmington, North Carolina, played on several Bob Dylan albums as a Nashville recording session guitarist in the late 1960s, including ""New Morning"" and ""Self-Portrait.""Eventually, at the age of 71, he was invited to join the epitome of Nashville's music establishment, the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted in the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2016.He said in 1998 that he kept touring so much because ""I have never played those notes perfectly. I've never sung every song perfectly. I'm in competition to be better tonight than I was last night and to be better tomorrow than tonight.""Daniels said his favorite place to play was ""anywhere with a good crowd and a good paycheck.""Notable deaths in 202078 photos"
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/companies-boycotting-facebook-ads-why-different-than-other-boycott/,More advertisers fleeing Facebook as boycott grows,['Irina Ivanova'],"['June 30, 2020']","A growing number of major advertisers are abandoning Facebook amid criticism the social media company is letting hateful or false posts go unchecked.Chipotle, HP, Pfizer and Puma are the latest to pull their ads from Facebook. They join a list of major brands including Adidas, Clorox, Coca-Cola, Conagra, Denny's, Ford, Starbucks, Unilever and scores of smaller businesses that have halted advertising on the platform. A pledge by Mark Zuckerberg on Friday to label rule-breaking posts has done little to mollify advertisers. In all, more than 100 brands have pledged to boycott the social media giant, while prominent critics including Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have also thrown their influential weight behind the boycott, according to reports. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxThe campaign also appears to have dented Facebook's stock. Its shares have dropped roughly 8% since the boycott started gaining steam last week, slashing $53 billion off the company's stock market value. Although Facebook has faced plenty of boycotts in the past, the latest campaign — spearheaded by leading civil rights groups such as the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League — could have more staying power, analysts say.""What's different this time is we have a bunch of significant large brands that are getting on board, and we have a number of large brands that are not getting on board with the boycott but taking action of their own beyond what the boycott asks for,"" said Nicole Perrin, principal analyst at eMarketer.                                Trending News                                    FDA warns about 5 additional toxic hand sanitizers                              Kanye West's Yeezy got millions in small business loans                              Treasury names small businesses receiving PPP loans                              Trump-connected lobbyists reap windfall in COVID-19 boom                              A second stimulus check? Here's how much you could get              Take Unilever. The consumer goods giant, which owns brands including Dove, Hellman's and Lipton, said it would stop advertising on Twitter as well as Facebook and Instagram until at least year-end. Unilever cited ""divisiveness"" on the platforms in its announcement that it would remove its advertising, but did not mention the boycott campaign led by the civil rights groups. Facebook to start labeling rule-breaking post...01:50Neither did Coca-Cola, which is pulling all social ads for a month, nor Clorox, which promised to stay off Facebook until December. Similarly, Starbucks merely announced its intention to stand against online hate-speech, saying in part: ""[Both] business leaders and policy makers need to come together to affect real change.""For Perrin, this is a sign that big brands could be getting uncomfortable with social media sites or user-generated content in general. Speaking of Unilever, she said, ""I thought this was an example of a brand expressing discomfort with being in places where people are essentially expressing in free political discussion ahead of an election. There was no way that there wasn't going to be division.""Asking for total harmony on the platform ""would be difficult to impossible for Facebook to deliver,"" she said, and would require ""fundamental changes to the way user-generated platforms operate, and how much they allow people to say."" Bottom-line impact?Big advertisers like Unilever — which spent just over $8 billion on marketing last year — as well as Clorox and Coca-Cola can help drive broader change in the media world. But when it comes to Facebook, their exodus doesn't do much to affect its bottom line. More than 8 million advertisers use the platform, according to eMarketer. The top 100 advertisers on Facebook contribute just 6% of its revenue, according to Pathmatics data cited by analysts at Raymond James, and no advertiser is irreplaceable. ""[S]ocial platforms are typically able to replace lost advertisers with other advertisers given the auction dynamics of the platforms,"" Aaron Kessler, an analyst with the investment bank, wrote in a note to investors.There are other reasons for big-name brands to avoid social media, Perrin noted. For many well-known consumer brands, the ability to target niche groups that Facebook offers may not be as important as it would be to smaller businesses. And, because of the coronavirus pandemic, advertisers were already looking to cut spending.Trump lauds Facebook, slams Twitter07:50Still, if there's a surefire way of getting Facebook's attention, vocal complaints by big advertisers rank high. Advertising still represents the vast majority of Facebook's revenue, and media reports indicate that senior executives at the company are working hard to keep ad buyers happy. The company's head of trust and safety policy recently acknowledged its ""trust deficit,"" according to the Financial Times.The campaigners have indicated that yanking U.S. ad spending is just a starting point. The CEO of Common Sense Media, one of the groups behind the Facebook ad boycott, told Axios the focus was shifting overseas, where many brands put their marketing dollars."

In a 24-page order Monday, Boasberg wrote that he was ""mindful of the disruption such a shutdown will cause,"" but said he had concluded that the pipeline must be shut down.""Clear precedent favoring vacatur during such a remand coupled with the seriousness of the Corps' deficiencies outweighs the negative effects of halting the oil flow for the thirteen months that the Corps believes the creation of an EIS will take,"" Boasberg wrote.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxBoasberg had ordered both parties to submit briefs on whether the pipeline should continue operating during the new environmental review.The pipeline was the subject of months of protests, sometimes violent, during its construction near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border.

Ancient skeletons were found in the narrow, twisting labyrinths of now-submerged sinkhole caves.Since skeletal remains like ""Naia,"" a young woman who died 13,000 years ago, were found over the last 15 years, archaeologists have wondered how they wound up in the then-dry caves. About 8,000 years ago, rising sea levels flooded the caves, known as cenotes, around the Caribbean coast resort of Tulum.Had these early inhabitants fallen in, or did they go down intentionally seeking shelter, food or water? Nine sets of human skeletal remains have been found in the underwater caves, whose passages can be barely big enough to squeeze through.Para obtener más información sobre Sagitario / La Mina en español, siga este enlace a nuestra pagina...Posted by El Centro Investigador del Sistema Acuífero de Quintana Roo A.C. on Friday, July 3, 2020Recent discoveries of about 900 meters of ocher mines suggest they may have had a more powerful attraction. The discovery of remains of human-set fires, stacked mining debris, simple stone tools, navigational aids and digging sites suggest humans went into the caves around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, seeking iron-rich red ocher, which early peoples in the Americas prized for decoration and rituals.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxSuch pigments were used in cave paintings, rock art, burials and other structures among early peoples around the globe.The early miners apparently brought torches or firewood to light their work, and broke off pieces of stalagmites to pound out the ocher. They left smoke marks on the roof of the caves that are still visible today.""While Naia added to the understanding of the ancestry, growth and development of these early Americans, little was known about why she and her contemporaries took the risk to enter the maze of caves,"" wrote researchers from the Research Center for the Aquifer System of Quintana Roo, known as CINDAQ for its initials in Spanish.

The early miners may have removed tons of ocher, which, when ground to a paste, can be used to color hair, skin, rocks or hides in varying shades of red.""Now we know that ancient humans did not risk entering this maze of caves just to get water or flee from predators, but that they also entered them to mine,"" Junco Sanchez said.However, James Chatters, forensic anthropologist, archaeologist, and paleontologist with Applied Paleoscience, a consulting firm in Bothell, Washington, noted that none of the pre-Maya human remains in the caves were found directly in the mining areas.Dr. Spencer Pelton, a professor at the University of Wyoming and the state archaeologist, has excavated a slightly older ocher mine at the Powars II site near Hartville, Wyoming.Pelton agreed that among the first inhabitants of the Americas, ocher had an especially powerful attraction.Red ocher mining ""seems especially important during the first period of human colonization ... you find it on tools, floors, hunt sites,"" Pelton said. ""It's a substance of great power ... everybody likes shiny red things.""""It gives them a reason"" to go into the caves, Pelton said, adding: ""Considering the massive scale of this mining, it's the first thing I would go for.""The caves provide a well-preserved environment and are where one of the oldest sets of human remains found in the Americas, a young woman nicknamed ""Naia,"" was discovered in 2007.Chatters said Naia ""most likely died from a 30 meter fall from the dark cave tunnel"" onto the floor of a chamber below."

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-boycott-advertisers-no-change/,"Facebook ad boycott is a tactical retreat for companies, not a cause",['Irina Ivanova'],"['July 1, 2020']","A range of major companies have have been quick to join an advertising boycott against Facebook amid concerns about hate speech and misinformation on the world's most popular social media site. Yet the move reflects more of a tactical retreat from the platform, experts say, with brands under enormous public pressure to take a stand against racism.Indeed, many of the 200 brands that committed to pause their marketing on Facebook were already likely to do that given that July, the month marked for the boycott, typically sees low spending on ads.  On top of that, the coronavirus-induced economic freeze has many   advertisers looking for a reason to cut back.""My opinion is  those  people were going to cut advertising anyway because of COVID,""  said  Laura Martin, an equity analyst who covers Facebook at investment bank Needham. The pandemic has not  only reduced how  much consumers spend, but it has changed behavior to  make other forms of  advertising, such as Google or connected TV ads,  more attractive, she added.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox""Facebook's competitive advantage is  reaching people on  their mobile devices, and everyone's sitting at  home right now,"" she  said. ""You can reach people at home, so you don't  need Facebook so much.  It's an easy way for companies to boycott [the  platform] without  hurting their bottom line.""One thing is for certain: Facebook's top ad spenders aren't budging. According to data from marketing intelligence firm Pathmatics, the 50 biggest advertisers on Facebook spent a total of $1.4 billion on ads in the first half of the year. Of those 50, only one — Starbucks — has joined the boycott. On Facebook-owned Instagram, five of the top 50 spenders have joined the boycott, representing 10% of the $455 million the platform's 50 highest spenders paid for advertising through June. Major spenders still on board include Disney, which spent $225 million on both platforms in the prior six months, Procter & Gamble and the U.S. Census Bureau, according to Pathmatics.Facebook removes Trump ads over symbol00:38Gogi Gupta, founder  of digital marketing agency Gupta Media, noted that Facebook is less strategically important for many of the companies distancing themselves from the company.

Here's how much you could get              ""If  you take  Coca-Cola, their brand is so strong, their distribution  network is so  strong, that if you take them out of Facebook it doesn't  change much,""  he said. Smaller companies, especially direct-to-consumer  brands like  Harry's or Casper, are much less likely to yank their ads because  their social-media  advertising is crucial to their sales. ""They spend a dollar to make six dollars, and  the minute  you turn that off, the impact to them is six times worse than  it is for  Facebook,"" he said. Pennies on the dollarDespite the attention the boycott has garnered, meanwhile, Wall Street appears unconcerned. Facebook's stock has risen 12% since Monday, indicating investor confidence that it will weather the scandal, like many others, with barely a dent to its bottom line.The boycott has so far cost Facebook about $150 million, Oppenheimer estimated. While that's a sizable figure for many businesses, it represents less than 1% of the $17 billion in ad revenue Facebook pulled in during the first quarter alone. If Facebook's top 100 advertisers all dropped off the platform, that would shave just 1% off its annual revenue, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak. Yet as of Wednesday, many of the top 100 continue to advertise on Facebook Those companies include AT&T, ViacomCBS (the corporate parent of CBSNews.com), Disney,  Home Depot, The New York Times, Walmart and Wix. Procter & Gamble, the world's top buyer of  advertising, has so far stopped short of pulling its ads off the platform,despite a recent promise to avoid ""hateful, discriminatory, denigrating or derogatory"" content. With about 8 million advertisers, Facebook is well-insulated from most customer complaints. Moreover, its auction model for selling ads means that  any advertiser that departs is easily replaced with another. ""We really think that it is important that advertisers exercise their brand virtues through advertising and where they choose to spend those dollars,"" Gupta said. But when it comes to boycotting Facebook, he said, ""It's hard for me to imagine this will have much impact.""Big tech companies expand amid crisis06:44While the Anti-Defamation League, one of the campaign's sponsors, has called the boycott ""a tremendous success so far,"" data indicate that new advertisers are coming in to replace those leaving. Gupta Media's analysis shows that the cost of Facebook ads has steadily risen since a low point in late March — and is now at the same level it was last year.For many brands, in other words, Facebook is just too good to give up. ""[M]ost advertisers cannot afford to pause [Facebook and Instagram] campaigns for more than a month given how effective FB is compared to other platforms,"" Oppenheimer analysts wrote in a research note.So while brands may want to boycott Facebook for longer to show they're in sync with their customer's values, Needham's Martin believes they will only do so for as long as COVID lockdowns continue. ""Right now  it doesn't cost [advertisers] anything to take a political stance here, but the  minute consumers leave their homes they're going to need Facebook,"" she said ""So economic  realities will overshadow their political goals."""

But if you still need more time to get your return in, filing for an extension is quick and straightforward.As in previous years, filing for an extension gives taxpayers until October 15 to get their tax return in. You can file an extension via commercial tax software, IRS Free File or even by physically mailing in Form 4868. The IRS strongly encourages people to file electronically, and offers a number of ways to do so via its website.

Scientists say it's ""a real risk""                              Rare case of brain-destroying amoeba confirmed in Florida                              9 hand sanitizer brands may be toxic, FDA warns              ""Our system in America is not built to serve everyone equally, and the health care system is not immune to that,"" she told CBS News. Most recently, doctors said, they've found biases in how Black patients have been treated during the coronavirus pandemic. Black people make up 13% of the U.S. population, but account for at least 23% of coronavirus deaths, according to the COVID Tracking Project. That prompted Webb and her colleagues to conduct a study that asked: When patients arrive at the emergency room, who was being tested for COVID-19?""What we found was that we were disproportionately ordering more tests for people who were White, despite the fact that it was the people of color who are disproportionately affected across our country,"" Webb said. ""Of the tests that we were ordering for people of color, those were coming back positive at a higher rate.""Coronavirus tests are just one example of how Black people often fare worse under the current health care system.Black people are significantly more likely than White people to suffer from chronic health conditions like diabetes and asthma, according to the CDC. They also have the highest mortality rate for all cancers compared to any other racial group, and an infant mortality rate that's nearly twice the national average.Research has also found that Black women are 42% more likely to die of breast cancer than White women, and that Black individuals are at higher risk of both developing and dying from colon cancer. Black men are more than 1.5 times more likely to get prostate cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while both Black men and women are more than twice as likely to develop myeloma, cancer of plasma cells. Black women are also roughly three times more likely than White women to die during childbirth, according to the CDC.                          Li Cohen/CBS News                      Internal medicine and public health doctor Michelle Morse, an assistant professor at Harvard University, said she saw that dynamic at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She said that around 2016, the hospital noticed a pattern in their emergency room that spanned at least a decade: Black and Latinx patients coming in for heart failure were more often admitted for treatment by general medicine providers than cardiology specialists. White patients, comparatively, were frequently treated by specialists who could provide better care.Heart failure patients who saw general providers, Morse explained, had a higher hospital readmission rate than those treated by specialists.""Often what happens is that Black and Brown patients get blamed for their outcomes not being as good as White folks,"" Morse said. ""So it again reinforces the fact that a lot of the racial inequities...are actually about the social conditions and the policies, not about the behavior, or compliance with medications, or biology, or genes, or DNA of Black and Latinx patients.""Since the study, Morse said the hospital developed a program called Adaptive Leaders for Racial Justice that teaches clinicians about antiracism and clinical medicine. They have also launched research to find out what drives triage decisions, and to find ways to improve the quality of heart failure care. ""We hope other institutions and clinicians will be equally committed to addressing inequities in their own contexts, systems, and care settings,"" Dr. Eldrin Lewis, director of the Cardiovascular Clerkship Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said in a press release. ""Ongoing institutional insistence on self-critique and recognition of the pervasiveness of structural racism and bias will increase the likelihood of success in achieving health equity at all U.S. institutions.""Webb explained that while many doctors tend to scold Black patients for inadequate health care, systemic issues are largely to blame. Economic inequality is part of that. Black people living in many major U.S. cities earn at least $30,000 less than their White counterparts, and are significantly more likely to be unemployed, live in poverty, and not own a home; according to the CDC, they are also less likely to be able to afford medical care. Black patients tend to go to the worst hospitals in the country, where patients are more likely to die from heart attacks or pneumonia, a 2011 study found.""Those years of not having care or not having access to medications or having insurance so that you can have a primary care doctor or, on a basic level, not having access to healthy foods or clean water, we see the manifestation of that in the emergency department,"" Webb said. ""And it's devastating to watch.""A 2018 study suggested that these disparities are at least partially linked to doctors believing that Black patients are less likely to improve or adhere to recommended treatments. Doctors also tend to believe Black patients are less responsible for their health, the study found. This belief, the study said, affects what treatments doctors provide.Jessica Simpson, who is Black, is a second-year medical student at Loyola University Chicago. She said she deals with this kind of racism daily interacting with non-Black medical students, and the school itself. She said implicit biases, such as discounting a patient's pain, are judgments and assumptions many people, including med students, don't realize they have. ""By nature, we develop social biases as a byproduct of just the normal function of our brains,"" she said. ""It's easier for our brains to label people, places, things, experiences, just because we have we live in a complex world ... so social biases create this lens that we have, for what we notice, and how we interpret the world.""Medical students at Loyola University Chicago organized a campaign in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.                         Courtesy of Jessica Simpson                      Simpson said many of these biases begin in medical school. She explained medical schools do not thoroughly teach the history and context of race in medicine, and said there is a lack of diversity to help facilitate the conversation.Black students tend to make up a small portion of medical school classes. In 2018-2019, just 1,238 out of the more than 19,900 med school graduates were Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.This, Simpson said, can impact the types of questions physicians ask their patients and the treatment they provide.In a 2016 study, researchers found many doctors and med students believe there are biological differences between Black and White people, and that Black people are not as sensitive to pain as their White counterparts. Because of this, the study said, Black people often receive inadequate pain treatment. ""It's difficult that we're still having to talk about this,"" Simpson said, ""but I also have hope."" Simpson started a chapter of the national organization White Coats for Black Lives at her school after the murder of George Floyd, and said addressing and being aware of racial inequalities — both in health care and beyond — is ""imperative"" for future physicians. ""We can no longer afford to be silent regarding matters of oppression,"" she told CBS News. ""It's our responsibility to learn about that and to learn about our own implicit biases in order to provide the same compassionate, patient-centered care to all of our patients, regardless of their race and ethnicity.""Doctors trying to fight bias in health care04:37Dr. Cameron Webb, University of Virginia Director of Health Policy and Equity and Leigh-Ann's husband, told CBS News that to change discriminatory outcomes, health care has to reprioritize and incentivize doctors to focus on quality care, not quantity care. Webb, the Democratic candidate in Virginia's 5th Congressional district, would be the first Black physician elected to Congress if he wins in November. ""Right now, it's very fee-for-service — you just do more things, you get more money,"" he said, adding that value-based contracts would ensure patients receive better quality and more affordable care. ""It really moves hospitals into thinking holistically about what makes patients sick, and invest a smart investment and making communities that are designed for people to be healthier. This kind of redesign disproportionately will benefit minority and lower-income communities.""""There's that old quote from Dr. Martin Luther King, that 'of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane,'"" Webb said. ""This is one of those moments when we're trying to root out injustice...this is the moment to lean into that work, and to recognize this is what it looks like to make a better nation.""Black individuals who have experienced racial bias and discrimination in health care say without more everyday action, the movement is ""like a Band-Aid.""""It soothes the soul, but my wound is still very much open,"" Jada said.

That prompted Webb and her colleagues to conduct a study that asked: When patients arrive at the emergency room, who was being tested for COVID-19?""What we found was that we were disproportionately ordering more tests for people who were White, despite the fact that it was the people of color who are disproportionately affected across our country,"" Webb said. ""Of the tests that we were ordering for people of color, those were coming back positive at a higher rate.""Coronavirus tests are just one example of how Black people often fare worse under the current health care system.Black people are significantly more likely than White people to suffer from chronic health conditions like diabetes and asthma, according to the CDC. They also have the highest mortality rate for all cancers compared to any other racial group, and an infant mortality rate that's nearly twice the national average.Research has also found that Black women are 42% more likely to die of breast cancer than White women, and that Black individuals are at higher risk of both developing and dying from colon cancer. Black men are more than 1.5 times more likely to get prostate cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while both Black men and women are more than twice as likely to develop myeloma, cancer of plasma cells. Black women are also roughly three times more likely than White women to die during childbirth, according to the CDC.                          Li Cohen/CBS News                      Internal medicine and public health doctor Michelle Morse, an assistant professor at Harvard University, said she saw that dynamic at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She said that around 2016, the hospital noticed a pattern in their emergency room that spanned at least a decade: Black and Latinx patients coming in for heart failure were more often admitted for treatment by general medicine providers than cardiology specialists. White patients, comparatively, were frequently treated by specialists who could provide better care.Heart failure patients who saw general providers, Morse explained, had a higher hospital readmission rate than those treated by specialists.""Often what happens is that Black and Brown patients get blamed for their outcomes not being as good as White folks,"" Morse said. ""So it again reinforces the fact that a lot of the racial inequities...are actually about the social conditions and the policies, not about the behavior, or compliance with medications, or biology, or genes, or DNA of Black and Latinx patients.""Since the study, Morse said the hospital developed a program called Adaptive Leaders for Racial Justice that teaches clinicians about antiracism and clinical medicine. They have also launched research to find out what drives triage decisions, and to find ways to improve the quality of heart failure care. ""We hope other institutions and clinicians will be equally committed to addressing inequities in their own contexts, systems, and care settings,"" Dr. Eldrin Lewis, director of the Cardiovascular Clerkship Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said in a press release. ""Ongoing institutional insistence on self-critique and recognition of the pervasiveness of structural racism and bias will increase the likelihood of success in achieving health equity at all U.S. institutions.""Webb explained that while many doctors tend to scold Black patients for inadequate health care, systemic issues are largely to blame. Economic inequality is part of that. Black people living in many major U.S. cities earn at least $30,000 less than their White counterparts, and are significantly more likely to be unemployed, live in poverty, and not own a home; according to the CDC, they are also less likely to be able to afford medical care. Black patients tend to go to the worst hospitals in the country, where patients are more likely to die from heart attacks or pneumonia, a 2011 study found.""Those years of not having care or not having access to medications or having insurance so that you can have a primary care doctor or, on a basic level, not having access to healthy foods or clean water, we see the manifestation of that in the emergency department,"" Webb said. ""And it's devastating to watch.""A 2018 study suggested that these disparities are at least partially linked to doctors believing that Black patients are less likely to improve or adhere to recommended treatments. Doctors also tend to believe Black patients are less responsible for their health, the study found. This belief, the study said, affects what treatments doctors provide.Jessica Simpson, who is Black, is a second-year medical student at Loyola University Chicago. She said she deals with this kind of racism daily interacting with non-Black medical students, and the school itself. She said implicit biases, such as discounting a patient's pain, are judgments and assumptions many people, including med students, don't realize they have. ""By nature, we develop social biases as a byproduct of just the normal function of our brains,"" she said. ""It's easier for our brains to label people, places, things, experiences, just because we have we live in a complex world ... so social biases create this lens that we have, for what we notice, and how we interpret the world.""Medical students at Loyola University Chicago organized a campaign in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.                         Courtesy of Jessica Simpson                      Simpson said many of these biases begin in medical school. She explained medical schools do not thoroughly teach the history and context of race in medicine, and said there is a lack of diversity to help facilitate the conversation.Black students tend to make up a small portion of medical school classes. In 2018-2019, just 1,238 out of the more than 19,900 med school graduates were Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.This, Simpson said, can impact the types of questions physicians ask their patients and the treatment they provide.In a 2016 study, researchers found many doctors and med students believe there are biological differences between Black and White people, and that Black people are not as sensitive to pain as their White counterparts. Because of this, the study said, Black people often receive inadequate pain treatment. ""It's difficult that we're still having to talk about this,"" Simpson said, ""but I also have hope."" Simpson started a chapter of the national organization White Coats for Black Lives at her school after the murder of George Floyd, and said addressing and being aware of racial inequalities — both in health care and beyond — is ""imperative"" for future physicians. ""We can no longer afford to be silent regarding matters of oppression,"" she told CBS News. ""It's our responsibility to learn about that and to learn about our own implicit biases in order to provide the same compassionate, patient-centered care to all of our patients, regardless of their race and ethnicity.""Doctors trying to fight bias in health care04:37Dr. Cameron Webb, University of Virginia Director of Health Policy and Equity and Leigh-Ann's husband, told CBS News that to change discriminatory outcomes, health care has to reprioritize and incentivize doctors to focus on quality care, not quantity care. Webb, the Democratic candidate in Virginia's 5th Congressional district, would be the first Black physician elected to Congress if he wins in November. ""Right now, it's very fee-for-service — you just do more things, you get more money,"" he said, adding that value-based contracts would ensure patients receive better quality and more affordable care. ""It really moves hospitals into thinking holistically about what makes patients sick, and invest a smart investment and making communities that are designed for people to be healthier. This kind of redesign disproportionately will benefit minority and lower-income communities.""""There's that old quote from Dr. Martin Luther King, that 'of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane,'"" Webb said.

In April last year, a court in southern India banned the app over complaints that it exposed children to sexual predators, cyberbullies, and pornographic content. But the court lifted the ban in just one week, after assurances from company representatives that they had fixed loopholes. Among the dozens of other apps banned by India on Monday are SHAREit and UC Browser. File sharing platform SHAREit is the third most active app in India after messenging service WhatsApp and Facebook, with more than 400 million downloads. UC Browser, owned by Alibaba Group's UCWeb, is the second most used web browser in India after Google Chrome.   Other banned Chinese apps include social networking, video editing, photo editing, and e-commerce platforms, and some games and other tools.

Senior Indian and Chinese military officers met again Tuesday morning, for the third time in two weeks, but no details of the meeting were immediately released. Deadly clash at India-China border01:46Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Sunday that his government had given a ""befitting response"" to China. Amid widespread calls in the country for a boycott of Chinese products, Modi said Indians would, ""buy local and be vocal for local, and this will help India become stronger."" While the government hasn't imposed any official restrictions on Chinese goods, the rhetoric is having an impact.Indian Railways has cancelled a signalling project contract with a Chinese company, and all public companies have reportedly been asked not to issue new contracts to Chinese firms. One federal minister even called for people to boycott restaurants serving Chinese food, which is popular across India.But in spite of the calls, China is India's second-largest trading partner after the U.S., and some analysts in the country have warned it could be difficult for New Delhi to ween a fast developing nation off Chinese goods.

While the world's been focused on other crises, an alarming study was released warning that species extinction is now progressing so fast that the consequences of ""biological annihilation"" may soon be ""unimaginable.""Dr. Jane Goodall, the world-renowned conservationist, desperately wants the world to pay attention to what she sees as the greatest threat to humanity's existence.CBS News recently spoke to Goodall over a video conference call and asked her questions about the state of our planet. Her soft-spoken grace somehow helped cushion what was otherwise extremely sobering news: ""I just know that if we carry on with business as usual, we're going to destroy ourselves. It would be the end of us, as well as life on Earth as we know it,"" warned Goodall.Dr. Jane Goodall at a reception in honor of Disney Conservation Funds 20th anniversary on April 18, 2016 in Orlando, Florida.                        Gustavo Caballero / Getty Images                      What follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation. Jeff Berardelli: Destruction of nature is causing some really big concerns around the world. One that comes to the forefront right now is emergent diseases like COVID-19. Can you describe how destruction of the environment contributes to this?Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxDr. Jane Goodall: Well, the thing is, we brought this on ourselves because the scientists that have been studying these so-called zoonotic diseases that jump from an animal to a human have been predicting something like this for so long. As we chop down at stake tropical rainforest, with its rich biodiversity, we are eating away the habitats of millions of animals, and many of them are being pushed into greater contact with humans. We're driving deeper and deeper, making roads throughout the habitat, which again brings people and animals in contact with each other. People are hunting the animals and selling the meat, or trafficking the infants, and all of this is creating environments which are perfect for a virus or a bacteria to cross that species barrier and sometimes, like COVID-19, it becomes very contagious and we're suffering from it. But we know if we don't stop destroying the environment and disrespecting animals — we're hunting them, killing them, eating them; killing and eating chimpanzees in Central Africa led to HIV/AIDS — there will be another one. It's inevitable.How environmental abuse has lead to epidemics...06:04Do you fear that the next [pandemic] will be a lot worse than this one?Climate Change                Jane Goodall: If humans don't change ""we're going to destroy ourselves""                              100.4° Arctic record confirmed; Earth may be warmest in 12,000 years                              ""We are at a crossroads"": Lawmakers unveil climate change plan                              Arctic records its hottest temperature ever                              2020 likely to be the warmest year on record globally                          More in Climate Change            Well, we've been lucky with this one because, although it's incredibly infectious, the percentage of people who die is relatively low. Mostly they recover and hopefully then build up some immunity. But supposing the next one is just as contagious and has a percentage of deaths like Ebola, for example, this would have an even more devastating effect on humanity than this one.I think people have a hard time connecting these, what may look like chance events, with our interactions and relationship with nature. Can you describe to people why the way that we treat the natural world is so important? Well, first of all, it's not just leading to zoonotic diseases, and there are many of them. The destruction of the environment is also contributing to the climate crisis, which tends to be put in second place because of our panic about the pandemic. We will get through the pandemic like we got through World War II, World War I, and the horrors following the World Trade towers being destroyed. But climate change is a very real existential threat to humankind and we don't have that long to slow it down. Intensive farming, where we're destroying the land slowly with the chemical poisons, and the monocultures — which can be wiped out by a disease because there is no variation of crops being grown — is leading to habitat destruction. It's leading to the creation of more CO2 through fossil fuels, methane gas and other greenhouse gas [released] by digestion from the billions of domestic animals. It's pretty grim. We need to realize we're part of the environment, that we need the natural world. We depend on it. We can't go on destroying. We've got to somehow understand that we're not separated from it, we are all intertwined. Harm nature, harm ourselves.If we continue on with business as usual, what do you fear the outcome will be?Well, if we continue with business as usual, we're going to come to the point of no return.  At a certain point the ecosystems of the world will just give up and collapse and that's the end of us eventually too. What about our children? We're still bringing children into the world — what a grim future is theirs to look forward to. It's pretty shocking but my hope is, during this pandemic, with people trapped inside, factories closed down temporarily, and people not driving, it has cleared up the atmosphere amazingly. The people in the big cities can look up at the night sky and sea stars are bright, not looking through a layer of pollution. So when people emerge [from the pandemic] they're not going to want to go back to the old polluted days. How the pandemic is improving air quality02:23Now, in some countries there's not much they can do about it. But if enough of them, a groundswell becomes bigger and bigger and bigger [and] people say: ""No I don't want to go down this road. We want to find a different, green economy. We don't want to always put economic development ahead of protecting the environment. We care about the future. We care about the health of the planet. We need nature,"" maybe in the end the big guys will have to listen.I often think our economic future, which is always put at the forefront, is actually dependent upon our ecological future. Without an ecological future, there is not going to be any economic growth. Would you agree? Absolutely. I mean, it's all been said again and again, but fossil fuels are not infinite, they will come to an end, leading to a lot more destruction of the environment for sure. Forests and natural resources are not infinite and yet we're treating them as though they are, and in some places using them up more quickly than nature can replenish them. We have to have a different kind of economy, we need a different way of thinking about what is success. Is it just about having more and more money, more and more stuff, being able to show off to your friends, and the wasteful society we live in? We waste clothes, we waste food, we waste laptops and cellphones. That pollutes the environment. So we've got to think differently, haven't we?So what do we do? Right now our worldview is based on GDP. You suggest that we think of it in a different way. So do you have a suggestion of how we rate our success other than GDP?I'm not an economist. I just know that if we carry on with business as usual, we're going to destroy ourselves. It would be the end of us, as well as life on Earth as we know it.So one thing we can do, those of us in affluent societies can almost all do with a bit less. We have a very unsustainable lifestyle. You can't really blame people, they grew up into it. But if you went through World War II like I did, when you took nothing for granted, one square of chocolate for a week is what we had and everything was rationed. So, you appreciate it. We never wasted even an ounce of food; not like today. Then, we also have to alleviate poverty. Because if you're really poor you destroy the environment, you cut down the last trees to make land to grow more food for your family, or fish the last fish. Or if you're in an urban area you buy the cheapest junk food. You don't have the luxury of asking: how is this made, did it harm the environment, did it lead to the suffering of animals like in the factory farms, is it cheap because of child slave labor? You just have to buy the cheapest in order to survive. Then the third thing, which nobody wants to talk about, but nevertheless ... there are approximately 7.8 billion of us on the planet today and already in some places we're using up natural resources faster than nature can replenish them. In 2050 it's estimated that there will be 9.7 billion of us. What will happen? We can't just go on burying it under the carpet. Population issues are politically sensitive so I talk about voluntary population optimization. So that's OK, it's voluntary, it is your choice. You optimize it for your financial situation. People are desperate to educate their children and they can't educate eight anymore. So they love family planning, and women can space out their children so that they can have a child and look after it. Let's switch gears. I don't eat animals. I have a dog. I love my dog. Let's talk about the idea that animals have feelings and that pigs are as intelligent as dogs...You know, animals are so much more intelligent than people used to think, and they have feelings and emotions and personalities, like your dog, any animal you share your life with. You know, birds now are making tools and octopus are incredibly intelligent. And when we think of all this trafficking of animals, selling them in meat markets or factory farms, when you think that each one one is an individual, can feel fear and pain, can suffer mentally as well as physically, isn't it shocking? I'm glad you don't eat them. I don't either, of course. Jane Goodall, the world's foremost authority on chimpanzees, communicates with a chimp named Nana at the zoo in Magdeburg, Germany, on June 6, 2004.                        JENS SCHLUETER/DDP/AFP via Getty Images                      The shock and horror because in China and South Korea they eat dogs — well, the thought of eating a dog makes me feel particularly sick, but not more sick than eating a pig. They eat dogs and we don't like it, but we eat pigs, and they are as intelligent as dogs. Isn't the point, if you must eat an animal shouldn't you treat it really well, like the Native Americans, respect the animal and give thanks that it's sacrificed itself for you?This is a bit more of a thought-provoking question: What has led us to this over-consumption in society? There is an idea that perhaps there is a Biblical basis, that we have dominion, that we're in charge, and because we're in charge we're able to do what we want. Can you give me an idea of why we are where we are, as a world right now, and what led us here? [Laughing] You think I'm going to be able to answer all these questions?I know it's a lot, but I know that you must have some thoughts on this. Well, first of all, I do think that religion has played a role. I was told by a Hebrew scholar the original translation of that word that you just mentioned, ""dominion,"" is wrong. It's actually something more like ""stewardship."" That's very different. If God gave us stewardship that's different from saying we have dominion. So I think religion started this thinking that we're so different from all the other animals and I was taught there was a difference in kind, not degree. Thank goodness the chimpanzees are so like us biologically, as well as behaviorally, that science had to start thinking differently. So how did we get there? It's sort of been like this all throughout human history. There were so many fewer of us back then that we could have these unsustainable lifestyles and it didn't really matter; they were sustainable. Think of how people have always exploited the natural world just because we can. And so there's been a lag between developing new technologies [which enable us to] destroy whole forests. Whereas the indigenous people might take a week to cut down the big tree, we can do it in an hour. And the moral evolution and the sense of a spiritual awareness and connection to the natural world on which we depend, that's lagged behind as well.So how do we repair that? How do we rediscover our connection to the rest of the natural world?As I think you know, I began a program for young people back in 1991 called Roots and Shoots because young people had lost hope in the future. I've met them all over the world. They were mostly apathetic and didn't seem to care. Or they were angry or deeply depressed and they told me they felt like that because we compromised their future and there was nothing they could do about it. And we have compromised their future. We've been stealing it for years and years. And yes, we still are still stealing it today. But when they said there was nothing they could do I thought, no, that's not right. We got this window of time. If we all get together, take action, we can start healing some of the harm, we can start slowing down climate change and we can work on educating people. Kids are really good at educating their parents and grandparents, some of whom may be in positions to make a huge difference, like CEOs of big companies or people in government. That program is now kindergarten to university and everything in between. It's in 68 countries and growing. Every group has the message: Each one of us — and that means you as well as me — we make some impact every single day and we have the luxury of choosing the impact that we make. Stunning photos of climate change63 photos"

The originally advertised final launch opportunity was August 5, but it was earlier extended to August 11 and now has been stretched to August 15 and possibly a bit beyond.In any case, NASA should have more than two weeks to get the flight off the ground before Earth and Mars move too far away from each other.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/my-stimulus-check-pay-income-taxes/,Stimulus check: Do you have to pay tax on the money?,['Aimee Picchi'],"['July 2, 2020']","The majority of people who qualify for a stimulus check have already received their direct deposits, paper checks or prepaid debit cards. But the payments — $1,200 for most single earners and $2,400 for most married couples — have raised plenty of questions about how they'll impact taxes. Chief among those is whether the payments, which are designed to help families weather the economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic, are subject to income taxes. In other words, should people set aside a chunk of the payment to pay the IRS when they file their 2020 tax returns? ""Something a lot of people don't realize is that stimulus payments are not taxable,"" Christina Taylor, head of tax operations at Credit Karma Tax, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""They're actually an advance on a new credit on your 2020 federal income taxes.""Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxIt's understandable that there's confusion among consumers. The IRS and Treasury's official term for the payments — economic impact payments — doesn't hint at the fact the payments are actually a type of tax credit, for example. Because the checks are advances on a tax credit for 2020, taxpayers will get another chance to reconcile their income and dependents information when they file their 2020 tax returns in early 2021. ""If you didn't qualify for the stimulus payment based on the prior year's income, but you do qualify for it based on your 2020 income, you can claim the stimulus payment as a credit on your 2020 tax return,"" Taylor noted.Meanwhile, many consumers are focused on whether a second stimulus check is in the works, with the unemployment rate remaining in the double digits and the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of July. Coronavirus: The Race To Respond                Stars remember Broadway actor Nick Cordero: ""What a light""                              Miami shuts down indoor dining and gyms as virus cases rise                              Atlanta mayor tests positive for coronavirus                              ICE says foreign students can't take online-only fall classes                              Only 40% of Harvard undergrads will return to campus this fall                          More in Coronavirus: The Race To Respond            What if my income falls in 2020?The stimulus checks that were authorized by the CARES Act in March have income thresholds. Single taxpayers who earn less than $75,000 qualify for the full $1,200 payment, while married couples who earn below $150,000 received $2,400. The payments are reduced for earnings above those thresholds, cutting off entirely for single taxpayers who earn more than $99,000 and for married couples with income above $198,000. When the IRS sent out checks starting in April, it based the payments on either your 2019 or 2018 tax returns, which reflect earnings before the coronavirus pandemic brought the economy to a standstill in March. That means if you are a higher earner whose income dropped in 2020 to below the income thresholds for the stimulus payments, you'll get the extra benefit when you file your taxes next year.People excluded from first stimulus checks sp...02:19That's because the IRS will reconcile the tax credit against your 2020 income, with tax experts saying it can only help you, not hurt you.Families also receive $500 for each child under 17, which means families with children born or adopted in 2020 will get a tax credit of $500 when they file their taxes next year, according to the IRS.Will I have to pay back stimulus money?Say your daughter was 16 when you filed your 2019 taxes, qualifying her for a $500 payment since she was under 17 at the time. What happens when you file your 2020 taxes and your daughter is 17, over the age that qualified her for that stimulus money — will you have to pay back the $500 to the IRS?No, says the tax agency.The same applies if your 2020 earnings places you above the threshold for a stimulus payment, while your 2019 or 2018 income was below the cutoff, the tax agency said.""There is no provision in the law requiring repayment of a payment,"" according to the IRS website. ""You won't be required to repay any payment when filing your 2020 tax return even if your qualifying child turns 17 in 2020 or your adjusted gross income increases in 2020 above the thresholds listed above.""What about my tax refund? Another question is whether stimulus payments will impact your tax refund next year. The answer is maybe — but only if it works out in your favor, according to Credit Karma Tax's Taylor.""For example, if your 2020 income was less than the income used to calculate your stimulus payment, you may receive a larger stimulus payment in the form of a credit when you file your 2020 taxes next year, which could increase your refund,"" she noted."

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-security-agency-warns-that-vpns-could-be-susceptible-to-cyberattacks/,National Security Agency warns that VPNs could be vulnerable to cyberattacks,['Olivia Gazis'],"['July 2, 2020']","The National Security Agency issued a new cybersecurity advisory on Thursday, warning that virtual private networks, or VPNs, could be vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured. The agency's warning comes amid a surge in telework as organizations adapt to coronavirus-related office closures and other constraints.A VPN allows users to establish private, encrypted connections to another network over the internet. They are used widely by corporations and other organizations to protect proprietary data from hackers while employees work remotely. A senior NSA official who briefed reporters Wednesday said the increase in remote work had attracted the attention of potentially malicious cyber actors.  Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox""We certainly see adversaries focused on telework infrastructure,"" the official said. ""We've seen exploitation and as a result, have felt that this was a product that is particularly helpful now.""VPN gateways in particular are ""prone to network scanning, brute force attacks, and zero-day vulnerabilities,"" the NSA's advisory said. ""[N]etwork administrators should implement strict traffic filtering rules to limit the ports, protocols, and IP addresses of network traffic to VPN devices."" The senior official said the NSA, whose employees deal daily with highly classified materials and systems, had taken its own steps to adapt to the pandemic, reducing some of its workforce to ""mission-essential"" for several weeks and introducing social distancing measures within its outposts.

Its mandate involves reinvigorating a set of missions the NSA has long had — protecting government and private sector systems — by accelerating, broadening and ""operationalizing"" its dissemination of unclassified threat information, according to officials.The directorate has now issued over a dozen public advisories since its launch. In October, it warned that nation-state actors were targeting VPN devices. In January, it was behind the disclosure of a ""critical vulnerability"" in Microsoft's Windows 10 software — something the agency might have once exploited, instead, as a hacking tool. And in May, in another rare move, it named a Russian military hacking unit that was secretly accessing commonly used email software.  ""Attribution is always interesting,"" the senior NSA official said Wednesday. ""We do it if we believe it creates a sense of urgency to address a vulnerability."" The directorate's emphasis on information-sharing stems from a recognition that nation states are getting more aggressive and more sophisticated in going after government and non-government targets. Its leadership has said it is also a conscious effort to move away from stubborn perceptions that the agency is a secretive black box — or ""No-Such-Agency,"" as the NSA has been labeled. (Its foreign intelligence mission — which involves intercepting signals and communications overseas — is likely to continue avoiding the public eye.)The agency has also broadened its presence on social media, launching an Instagram account, a dedicated Twitter account for the directorate, and even bringing its notoriously circumspect director to the platform. (Paul Nakasone has tweeted three times in three weeks.)""General Nakasone has looked at the environment and said, 'We see adversaries increasingly using cyber to achieve national security objectives below the level of armed conflict,'"" the senior official said. ""'We're seeing rapid technological change, which just brings in a whole new set of vulnerabilities.'""""It led him to say, 'We really need to up our game.'"""

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ppp-treasury-names-small-businesses-receiving-loans/,"Treasury names 650,000 companies that got U.S. small business loans",[],"['July 6, 2020']","The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday released the names of more than 650,000 companies that received funds from the government's small business lending program, a massive effort intended to support the economy as states shut down in April to contain the viral outbreak.The Treasury Department identified just a fraction of the total borrowers, naming only those companies that got more than $150,000 in low-interest, forgivable loans through banks working with the U.S. Small Business Administration. Those companies made up less than 15% of the nearly 5 million small businesses that received loans. The records released Monday show they include companies tied to the governors of Ohio, New Hampshire and West Virginia, among others, as well as hundreds of private equity firms, securities firms that do business on the New York Stock Exchange, and even payday lenders that charge consumers some of the highest interest rates allowed.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxThe average loan amount for the entire program was $107,000, the Treasury Department said in a broad summary of the program. The government handed out $521 billion through the Paycheck Protection Program, a crucial piece of the government's $2 trillion rescue package. The loans, which charge just 1% interest, can be forgiven if the businesses mostly use the money to continue paying their workers.Strip club owner got $5.4 million Paycheck Protection Program loan40% of Black business owners may not survive the coronavirus crisisPaycheck program didn't save enough jobs, economists sayThe recipients employed 51 million people before the pandemic began, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, or about 85% of all workers at companies with fewer than 500 employees. Not all of those jobs were saved. The government won't know how many were until companies apply to have the loans forgiven, a process that is just beginning.While the data included demographic information on some the borrowers, the officials said it was incomplete because companies were not required to supply information on their owners' race, ethnicity and gender. More of that data may become available when borrowers apply to have the loans forgiven.

Here's how much you could get              But the government was able to determine that 27% of the loan money went to businesses operating in low- and moderate-income areas, the officials said.Emergency small business relief fund runs dry...06:35The PPP was up and running just days after being approved by Congress in late March. It provided loans of up to $10 million for small businesses to help them recover from the government-ordered shutdowns and revenue losses caused by the virus outbreak. The ability to convert the loans to grants made the program seem particularly appealing.Once opened April 3, the PPP sparked a flood of applications from desperate small business owners. The SBA approved more than 1.6 million loans worth $349 million in less than two weeks, exhausting the initial funding. Millions of other businesses had to wait nearly two more weeks for Congress to approve an additional $310 million. Nearly 3.2 million loans worth $172 billion were approved in the second round as of June 30, leaving around $132 billion unclaimed. Congress approved an extension of the program this week until Aug. 8.Economists generally credit the program with helping prevent the job market meltdown from being much worse. Employers added 7.5 million jobs in May and June, a solid increase although it still left the economy with nearly 15 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic. Many economists credit the PPP with driving some of that gain.Yet other analyses, such as one conducted by economists at Standard & Poor's, found that businesses in states with fewer job losses received more loans than those in harder-hit states.Private equity-owned companies got helpNearly 600 portfolio management companies and private equity firms took money from the PPP program, an Associated Press review of the data show.Private equity firms and portfolio managers were not an industry heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Their employees were largely able to keep working, and they were not industries that had to be shut down by state or local government orders. Investment managers and private equity firms also tend to be extremely well paid positions.According to the data, those 583 companies reported saving roughly 14,800 jobs collectively with the funds from the program. That'a an average of 25 employees per company.Rosenblatt Securites, one of the biggest names on the floor of the NYSE, took out a $1 million to $2 million loan.Political names received money Some familiar political names are showing up in data revealing who received funding for businesses during the outbreak.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice's family companies received at least $6.3 million from the federal rescue package. Justice, a Republican, is considered to be West Virginia's richest man through ownership of dozens of coal and agricultural businesses, many of which have been sued for unpaid debts. At least six Justice family businesses received the Paycheck Protection Program loans, including the Greenbrier Sporting Club, an exclusive members-only club attached to a lavish resort Justice owns called the Greenbrier. A representative for the governor's family companies did not immediately return emails seeking comment.A company owned by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine is among those that received loans. Data released Monday shows DeWine Seeds-Silver Dollar Baseball received a loan under the PPP for a range of $150,000 to $350,000. The company owns the Asheville Tourists, a minor league baseball team in North Carolina, which was purchased by the governor's family in 2010. DeWine's son, Brian DeWine, is the president of the baseball team.Waterville Valley Holdings, an investment group led by the family of New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, got a loan of between $350,000 and $1 million. The company is the principal investor in the Waterville Valley Resort, a ski area where Sununu, a Republican, served as CEO until just before he took office in 2017.Robin J. Vos Enterprises, a popcorn manufacturing company run by Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos received between $150,000 and $350,000. Vos is a Republican and his spokeswoman, Kit Beyer, didn't immediately respond to a message inquiring about why the company was seeking the money and how it's been used.An owner of 750 restaurants got loansMuy Brands Inc., a San Antonio, Texas, franchisee with more than 750 Wendy's, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants, received between $15 million and $30 million through the Paycheck Protection Program.CEO James Bodenstedt is also a major donor to President Trump. He has given $300,000 to the Trump Victory PAC since the start of this year, according to federal campaign finance records. A message seeking comment was left with Muy Brands.Payday lenders among the government borrowersRoughly 120 payday lenders and auto title lenders took loans from the Paycheck Protection Program. Most took out smaller loans, typically less than $350,000. These types of businesses typically lend money to poor and disaffected individuals in desperate need for cash, often at high interest rates.Online lenders which often offer to consolidate loans in return for high fees also took government loans. Avant, Prosper Marketplace and Upstart were among them.Creditcorp, a high interest-rate lender and debt collector, took out a loan of between $5 million and $10 million loan."

Jones' case will now go back to the federal district court, a rare second chance for police brutality suits. Qualified immunity, which the Supreme Court created decades ago, has become a focal point of the debate on policing following the death of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody in May. Activists believe reforming the doctrine could increase the accountability of law enforcement. On Capitol Hill, House Democrats recently passed a bill that calls for eliminating the doctrine.

Senator Tim Scott told ""Face the Nation"" amending qualified immunity would be a ""poison pill"" for getting any legislation passed, and President Trump has threatened to veto any such measure. Tim Scott: Ending immunity a ""poison pill"" in...08:00The doctrine requires families to find nearly identical cases of excessive force that prove what officers did was unconstitutional. For example, a homeless man in Tennessee sued after a police dog bit him during a 2014 arrest. A previous case found it unconstitutional for officers to deploy a dog if someone surrendered and was lying down. The Supreme Court denied the petition, arguing that it wasn't similar enough because the man, in this case, was sitting, instead of lying on the ground.The Supreme Court created the doctrine in 1967 to provide government officials a ""good faith"" defense if they believed their conduct was legal. It was spurred by a case where two Mississippi police officers arrested and jailed 15 priests, three of whom were black, for refusing to leave a segregated bus terminal waiting room in 1961. The group sued for false imprisonment, but the court sided with the officers who said they believed they were preventing imminent violence from a crowd.   Now, advocates of qualified immunity believe eliminating it would subject police departments to frivolous lawsuits and lead to a mass exit of officers from the workforce. Patrick Yoes, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, testified before the Senate last week, saying the doctrine grants officers the discretion to make split-second decisions when their lives could be at risk. He said his organization, which represents 350,000 members, was strongly opposed to ending qualified immunity.Jack Collins, a legal adviser for the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said removing the protection would be ""counterproductive"" toward efforts to create a more accountable system because it would hurt departments' abilities to recruit and retain qualified officers.""For those bad people, they're not going to be prevented from doing bad, ugly things because you subject every officer to frivolous lawsuits,"" he added. ""Abolishing qualified immunity is just a really false effort by people who are frustrated, with good reason, at some bad cops, but you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.""Joanna Schwartz, a professor at UCLA Law, said weak cases against officers are often weeded out by the system. According to her study of nearly 1,200 lawsuits, fewer than 4% of the cases were dismissed on qualified immunity grounds. Experts said other factors often kill cases before the doctrine can even be invoked, including procedural barriers and challenges to bringing claims in the first place. Bruce Jones believes the ""system isn't made to work"" for people who can't financially afford to go up against police. He said he hopes the prospect of a long legal battle doesn't deter other alleged victims of police brutality from taking action. ""I would tell them if they still have a chance to fight for justice, fight for justice,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, even sometimes when there's a camera you can't get justice because there's always an excuse or an explanation, but never give up fighting for your rights.""Melissa Quinn contributed to this report."

Now, he's completed his associate's graduate, hoping to eventually work with kids in another capacity – as a teacher. Clayton Ward's family owned a school bus company in Tennessee, and when he moved to Massachusetts, he followed in their footsteps and became a school bus driver. Ward attended college 10 years ago but dropped out after a few semesters. ""I never lost that need or that want to do more schooling or have a degree,"" Ward told CBS News on Tuesday. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox""I got the inspiration [to go back] after talking specifically to my high schoolers about a passion of mine, which is history,"" Ward said. ""Just talking with them a little bit about history ... it inspired me, especially hearing them say, 'You should be my teacher.'""So, in May of last year, he enrolled at MassBay Community College while still driving a bus in Framingham full-time. His ultimate goal was to become a high school history teacher. Ward said eventually, the students that he talked to on the bus learned that he had gone back to school. ""It came up in conversation, especially some of the older ones who are starting to look at colleges ... I said, 'If you're looking at community college, you should look at MassBay, it's a good school,'"" he said. ""Once they realized that I was going to school, they started asking questions about what it was like and stuff like that.""Clayton Ward said one quote from his former high school teacher kept him inspired during college: ""It's about your discipline. It's not about doing the right thing when people are watching you, it's doing the right thing when they're not watching you.""                        MassBay Community College                      At MassBay, Ward focused on doing his best in school while continuing to work, and he earned a spot on the Dean's list every semester.

It's not about doing the right thing when people are watching you, it's doing the right thing when they're not watching you,"" he said. He was especially grateful for school when the pandemic hit. He no longer had to get up for work, and his classes gave his days some structure, he said. Now that he's finished his associate's degree – in three semesters – Ward is going to Framingham State to complete his bachelor's degree. ""It's right in the area where I would like to teach, because Framingham is a lower-income city. That's where I'm geared to go towards, just because of my experience. Even with my family and their bus company, a lot of the routes we did were through lower-income housing,"" he said. Ward will attend MassBay's virtual commencement ceremony on Tuesday night, and said some friends would be joining him to celebrate the accomplishment. ""I'm still on cloud nine,"" he said. ""I didn't think I would ever be at this point ... I expected to do well, but I didn't imagine doing straight As, I didn't imagine being on the Dean's list, getting three or four awards for having one of the best GPAs for the graduating class. It's still kind of all surreal to me.""The graduate said maybe it will all set in when they announce his name during the virtual graduation. ""But for now, I still have my head up in the clouds – which is driving me more.""Ward said he has one message for the high schoolers who inspired him: ""You guys mean so much to me. I thank you for every time we were able to talk. It gave me more of a drive, more ambition to go [to school]."""

A final power circuit will be equipped with new batteries during two more spacewalks later this month, wrapping up a complex multi-year upgrade.The battery replacement work Wednesday was completed in short order and the astronauts were able to press ahead with a few lower-priority ""get-ahead"" tasks. The only one that did not get accomplished was the planned removal of a ground handling fixture on one of the canisters anchoring a set of solar arrays.After unbolting the fixture, Robert Behnken was unable to pull it free, despite using a pry bar and a bit of elbow grease. Flight controllers finally told him to bolt it back down, deferring the removal to a future spacewalk. NASA plans to remove several such no-longer-needed fixtures to clear the way for a planned power system upgrade.Astronaut Robert Behnken heads back to the International Space Station's airlock after a successful six-hour spacewalk.

Cassidy and Behnken are working to replace a final set in the station's right-side outboard arrays.Last Friday, they removed five of the six nickel-hydrogen batteries in one of the outboard power channels and installed two of three lithium-ion batteries and two of three adapter plates in their place.During Wednesday's work, they finished upgrading power channel 1B and loosened bolts securing batteries in power channel 3B to save time during the first of two spacewalks later this month to finish the battery replacement work. Before calling it a day, they routed power and data cables for a new wireless communications system and attempted to remove the handling fixture. Engineers will troubleshoot that issue to come up with a fix for a downstream spacewalk."

""The path of least resistance is still two steps forward, one step back,"" Schutte said.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox""Broadly speaking, the market is reacting to economic data that is  better than expected,"" he added.The stock market's strong run in recent weeks follows a devastating 20% ""correction"" earlier this year that marked its worst quarter since the 2008 financial crisis.

Morgan Private Bank.Another factor that's helped keep markets climbing overall is a sense  among traders that even as some states pause reopening or order some  businesses shut down again in response to rising new confirmed COVID-19  cases, the economy is on the mend.""It's a recognition that the worst of the economic impact is behind  us,"" Lyon said. ""The question is just the pace of the reopening and the  return of normalcy. Even though it's probably going to be slower, it's  still in a positive trajectory.""Less clear is how long the party will continue. A rise in coronavirus infections since numerous states lifted restrictions on businesses in May now has some local governments pausing their reopening. The surge in confirmed new cases, which has prompted the European Union to bar U.S.  travelers from entry, is seeding doubts that the economic recovery can happen as quickly as markets had forecast. Beyond the coronavirus, analysts also point to the upcoming U.S.  elections  and other risks that could upset markets. If Democrats sweep  Capitol Hill and the White House, which many investors see as at least  possible, it could mean higher tax rates, which could weaken corporate  profits.""While the economy appears poised to recover, the timing is unclear, and the path is likely to be full of twists and turns"" analysts with the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a note to investors.

With a national pandemic and the worst economic contraction in recorded U.S. history, taxes might not be the fist thing on your mind. If you need more time than the already-extended July 15 deadline provides, filing for an extension until October 15 is straightforward and takes just a few minutes.But what if you haven't filled out your tax return in years? What if you never file taxes?In the best-case scenario, non-filers could be missing out on money owed  to you, experts say. In the worst case, you could be on the hook for  penalties and interest, and enter into a protracted battle with the IRS.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxSometimes people skip filing a tax return once and get stuck not filing year after year because they're afraid of the penalty, according to Nina Olson, the founder of the Taxpayer Rights Center.""Something I see a lot is people get behind one year, and then they think, 'Well, I'm not going this file this year because I owe money,'"" Olson told CBS News in a February interview. ""Then they [don't] file the next year because they think, 'If I file the next year, they'll fine me for the last year. But I'm owed a refund this year. But I'm just gonna stay underground.' And then they keep going on, and then finally the IRS finds them. And then it's a mess."" Olson should know — she served as the National Taxpayer Advocate for 19 years before stepping down in 2019.

Here's how much you could get              In these cases, she says, ""the worst thing that you can do is nothing at all."" Reaching out to the agency to tell them you may owe taxes is always preferable than having the IRS find you. The tax agency acknowledged that people's finances may be tight because of the pandemic, and encouraged taxpayers to get in touch. ""The IRS understands that those affected by  the coronavirus may not be able to pay their balances in full by July  15, but we have many payment options to help taxpayers,"" IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in a statement. ""These easy-to-use payment options are available on IRS.gov, and most can be done automatically without reaching out to an IRS representative.""The agency offers a guide for filing taxes if it's been a while, as well as a tool to find out if you're not required to file.When the feds do your taxes If you've gone a decade without filing a tax return and nothing has happened, that doesn't mean you're off the hook. If you have any income at all, the agency can use that to essentially file a tax return on your behalf. Tax experts note that almost any non-cash income you get is reported to the IRS. That could be pay stubs from a job, a 1099 from your bank or brokerage, money from a gig or side hustle or earnings from selling on Amazon or eBay. What the Tax Day extension means for you04:10If you haven't filed a return, the IRS can use all that information to automatically create a tax return for you — something known as an Automated Substitute for Return, or ASFR. Some 380,000 taxpayers got this treatment in 2019, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate. Unlike your personal accountant, the ASFR program will assume the worst for the taxpayer: It takes into account income, but ignores any deductions they may be entitled to. ""Let's say you're married with five children — that would really impact your taxable income. But the IRS doesn't know that,"" Olson said.If you receive an ASFR, as with any tax notice, tax experts suggest reaching out to the IRS as soon as possible. After a certain period, if the IRS doesn't hear from you it will start collection proceedings — including such things as freezing your bank account or garnishing your wages.The feds have no deadline There's one other reason not to delay. The IRS' timeline to go after non-filers is essentially unlimited. ""[T]here's no statute of limitations for assessing and collecting the tax if no return has been filed,"" the agency says. If you file a return, the IRS has three years to audit it and ask for additional tax. (In extreme circumstances the deadline extends to six years.) The same goes for taxpayers, who have a three-year time limit to claim any refunds they may be owed. Many people, especially those eligible for tax credits, may not know to expect money from the government. As many as 1.4 million people who didn't file taxes for 2016 will soon run out of time to claim their money, the IRS said last week. They have until July 15 to ask for it — by filing a tax return."

The trip also marks the president's first campaign rally in a political battleground and second mega-event since his hiatus from the trail due to the coronavirus pandemic.  The president's reelection campaign announced Sunday that the rally will take place at Portsmouth International Airport at 8 p.m. ET. According to a statement released by the Trump campaign, the outdoor event will feature ""ample access to hand sanitizer"" and all attendees ""will be provided a face mask that they are strongly encouraged to wear.""Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox""President Trump's record-setting accomplishments in record-setting time have improved the lives of all Americans. He rebuilt, restored and renewed our great nation once, and he'll do it again,"" said campaign press secretary Hogan Gidley in a statement. ""We look forward to so many freedom-loving patriots coming to the rally and celebrating America, the greatest country in the history of the world.""There have been over 5,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases in New Hampshire, and more than 380 deaths, according to the state's Department of Public Health. Nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire residents disapprove of Mr. Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a University of New Hampshire survey released last month. In a survey of New Hampshire voters released last month, Mr. Trump trails Joe Biden.

Mr. Trump's campaign packed the same SNHU arena in August 2019 for an indoor campaign rally, boasting thousands of attendees and hundreds of protesters.But it was in 2011 that then-real estate mogul Donald Trump first dropped into Portsmouth International Airport in a Trump-emblazoned black helicopter to explore a GOP primary bid, after pushing false rumors that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.Mr. Trump lost New Hampshire in 2016 by fewer than 3,000 votes, a slim 0.4% margin of votes cast.The upcoming rally,  just a few short miles from the Maine border, is expected to also draw supporters from the neighboring state. In 2016, Mr. Trump won Maine's 2nd congressional district, making him the first Republican to score Maine electoral votes since George H. W. Bush in 1988.  The president's joint field operation with the Republican National Committee has resumed in-person organizing in New Hampshire, including door-knocking, on June 15. Under CDC guidelines, organizers employ hand sanitizer and temperature checks while hosting statewide in-person events.Mr. Trump began two weeks ago holding in-person rallies again, with a kick-off relaunch at the indoor BOK Center arena in Tulsa, Oklahoma. At least eight campaign advance staff tested positive for coronavirus while preparing for the president's event.The Portsmouth rally will be Mr. Trump's first campaign outdoors campaign rally in 2020. Republican candidate for New Hampshire's 1st congressional district, Matt Mowers, a 2016 Trump campaign official endorsed by the president, told CBS News he is excited to welcome the president back. ""This trip shows how important winning this district and New Hampshire is to the president.""The Republican mayor of the Democratic-leaning city of Portsmouth, Rick Becksted, said he learned of the rally Sunday evening while watching the news and receiving email inquiries.       New Hampshire Democratic chair Ray Buckley criticized Mr. Trump for coming into the city. ""Trump's response to the COVID-19 crisis has been chaotic and woefully inadequate, resulting in thousands of Granite Staters contracting the virus and hundreds of lives lost, while causing significant damage to our state's economy,"" Buckley wrote in a statement to CBS News. ""Instead of helping our state safely recover, Trump is flying in for a political rally that will only further highlight the chaos he has caused."""

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uscis-funding-13400-immigration-workers-furlough-coronavirus/,"Standoff over emergency funding leaves 13,400 immigration workers facing furlough",['Camilo Montoya'],"['July 6, 2020']","In less than 30 days, the cash-strapped U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will start furloughing more than 13,400 employees — nearly 70% of its workforce — unless Congress authorizes emergency funding to avoid a scenario that would cripple the nation's legal immigration system.USCIS — which administers green card applications, work permits, asylum requests, naturalization ceremonies for would-be U.S. citizens and other immigration services — has been facing an unprecedented financial crisis, which it attributes to a drastic decrease in applications during the coronavirus pandemic that has deprived the fee-funded agency of its main source of revenue. Thousands of USCIS employees have already received notices of their looming furloughs, which would start on August 3. ""If that happens, the agency would be left with a skeleton crew that will make it difficult to sustain our critical mission of administering our nation's lawful immigration system,"" Joseph Edlow, deputy director for policy at USCIS and the de facto head of the agency, said in a statement to CBS News.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxUSCIS, which is a division of the Department of Homeland Security, informed Congress of its financial woes in the middle of May, requesting $1.2 billion in emergency funding and promising to repay the funds by imposing a 10% surcharge on applications. However, in the ensuing weeks, a standoff has emerged between Congress and the Trump administration, leaving a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the USCIS workforce and the millions of immigrants who file petitions with the agency in any given year.People take the oath of citizenship during a naturalization ceremony at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service's Field Office on Thursday, July 2, 2020, in New York.                        Frank Franklin II / AP                      Democratic and Republican congressional officials said the administration has yet to file a formal budget request, frustrating the lawmakers responsible for authorizing the funds. ""It's a moving target right now in terms of what specifically it is that we need to address in order to prevent these furloughs,"" Democratic Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, the chair of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, told CBS News. ""Everyone is in agreement and focusing on the fact that we're going to prevent those furloughs. But unfortunately, with OMB not taking any action at this time, it is very difficult to sit down and finalize what exactly is needed,"" Roybal-Allard added, referring to the White House Office of Management and Budget.Immigration                ICE says foreign students can't take online-only fall classes                              Standoff over funding leaves 13,400 immigration workers facing furlough                              Judge blocks Trump's asylum restriction for border-crossers                              Lawmakers urge ICE to release families together following court order                              Judge orders release of migrant children, citing coronavirus                          More in Immigration            The Trump administration, however, says Congress has all it needs to bailout USCIS. ""The Administration has formally requested the resources necessary to keep USCIS running,"" an OMB spokesperson told CBS News. ""Our hope is that Congressional Democrats accept our proposal to keep the lights on in a responsible manner.""On June 19, Acting OMB Director Russell Vought sent letters to congressional appropriators expressing support for a ""pay-it-forward deficit neutral approach"" to grant USCIS emergency funds. The letters, however, did not specify an amount.""The Trump White House is responsible for requesting supplemental funding, but all they have sent Congress is a one-page letter that provides virtually no information on the shortfall or proposed remedies,"" said Evan Hollander, a spokesperson for the House appropriations panel. ""Despite this egregious lack of communication, House Democrats are closely tracking USCIS' financial difficulties and are prepared to discuss solutions as part of negotiations on the next phase of coronavirus response legislation. So far, Senate Republicans are unwilling to begin those talks.""A Republican Senate aide said House appropriators have not reached out about the USCIS emergency funds. The aide also said the White House has not made a formal request for the funds, noting that Vought's June 19 letter did not include a dollar figure.Roybal-Allard said she and other lawmakers are also asking USCIS to identify the factors — in addition to fewer applications during the pandemic — that precipitated the agency's budget shortfall. Congress has yet to receive a response, she said. ""COVID is definitely a factor, but I don't believe that it is the whole reason that we are in this situation. And that's exactly what we're trying to find out, so that it can be corrected and we don't end up in the same place next year,"" she said.""A recipe for disaster""In May, USCIS attributed the agency's potential bankruptcy to a ""dramatic"" drop in applications during the pandemic, predicting that it would see a 61% decline in petition receipts through the end of September. An agency spokesperson said receipts ""have slightly improved"" since, but noted that the $1.2 billion request to Congress remained ""unchanged.""There is consensus among lawmakers, congressional staff, immigration experts and USCIS employees that the pandemic has had a large impact on the agency's operations and fee-funded model. USCIS had to postpone in-person interviews, fingerprint and photo appointments, naturalization ceremonies and other services because of the coronavirus. Though some have reopened in a limited capacity, virtually all offices were closed to the public in the spring. The agency has recently conducted smaller naturalization ceremonies, but hundreds of thousands of immigrants seeking to finalize their path to U.S. citizenship are still waiting to complete their postponed appointments. However, there's disagreement over whether the coronavirus is the sole catalyst of USCIS' dire financial predicament. Lawmakers, experts, former USCIS officials and current employees believe the agency's fiscal crisis had been brewing well before the coronavirus became widespread in the U.S., fueled by the Trump administration's restrictive immigration policies and funding priorities.USCIS publicly forecast a $1.26 billion deficit in November 2019, when it proposed fee hikes for a wide-range of its services. A recent analysis by the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute shows that revenue from petition fees has declined in the past three consecutive fiscal years — a trend that ran parallel to dwindling petitions for programs the administration has limited or sought to dismantle entirely. In fiscal year 2019, USCIS brought in $13 million less in fee revenue than in 2018, which had already seen a $152 million drop in petition funds from the previous year.Between fiscal years 2017 and 2019, USCIS has seen a significant drop in petitions for family-based green cards, naturalization, including from U.S. service members, and programs that protect certain immigrants from deportation, like Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, and the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The Trump administration has sought to end the TPS and DACA programs, but its efforts have been stymied by the courts. It has also taken unilateral action to restrict family-based immigration, including by imposing a broad wealth test for green cards that is expected to disproportionately affect low-income applicants. Citing the economic impact of the pandemic, President Trump has recently issued two sets of restrictions to limit immigrant and work visas.""Over the last four years, the policies of this administration and the way that they ran things pushed the agency to the very edge of a cliff — and COVID was the finger on the back that sent it over,"" a USCIS employee who requested anonymity to speak freely told CBS News. Another USCIS employee, who also requested anonymity and had received a furlough notice, agreed, noting the agency recently expanded its fraud detection and national security units. ""To double the size of a directorate that doesn't actually perform the core function of our agency — which is to adjudicate requests for immigration benefits — is a recipe for financial disaster,"" the employee told CBS News.USCIS pushed back on this criticism. ""There is nothing in the budget or the analysis to suggest that there is any drop in our receipts that is outside historical norms based on any policy that has been implemented during this administration,"" a spokesman said. ""In fact, the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 was better by $100M than fiscal year 2019 and far better ($200M) than it was in 2016, which should illustrate just how far receipts fell in late March forward due to COVID-19.""León Rodríguez, who led USCIS during President Barack Obama's second term, said the current situation could highlight the value of having some of the agency's offices, like those for processing asylum and refugee requests, transition from a fee-funded model, to one appropriated by Congress. ""Because both asylum and refugee work are so bound up with U.S. foreign policy — and the humanitarian and national security strategic objectives of U.S. foreign policy — it makes sense for that to be a shared investment of all the American people,"" Rodríguez told CBS News.Michael Knowles, an asylum officer and president of the union for USCIS employees in the Washington, D.C. area, said he doesn't think the American public has fully grasped the consequences of his agency's potential partial shutdown. ""Millions of people will be affected, not just people who have yet to come to the U.S., but millions who are here. Millions of workers who depend on their work permits. Millions of lawful, tax paying residents who deserve to become citizens.""Knowles said he's still hopeful Congress and the administration may reach a compromise before August 3, noting that the two branches have frequently acted ""at the last minute"" during crises.Sara Cook contributed to this report."

Many are donors to Trump's campaigns, and some are prolific fundraisers for his reelection.They include Brian Ballard, who served on the transition, is the finance chair for the Republican National Committee and has bundled more than $1 million for Trump's fundraising committees. He was hired in March by Laundrylux, a supplier of commercial laundry machines, after the Department of Homeland Security issued guidance that didn't include laundromats as essential businesses that could stay open during the lockdown. A week later, the administration issued new guidance adding laundromats to the list.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxDave Urban, a Trump adviser and confidant, has collected more than $2.3 million in lobbying fees this year.

But during his administration, the lobbying industry has flourished, a trend that intensified once Congress passed more than $3.6 trillion in coronavirus stimulus.While the money is intended as a lifeline to a nation whose economy has been upended by the pandemic, it also jump-started a familiar lobbying bonanza.

""These (lobbying) booms that these people are having, you can really attribute them to their connection to Trump.""The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Shortly after Trump took office, he issued an executive order prohibiting former administration officials from lobbying the agency or office where they were formerly employed, for a period of five years. Another section of the order forbids lobbying the administration by former political appointees for the remainder of Trump's time in office.Yet five lobbyists who are former administration officials have potentially done just that during the coronavirus lobbying boom:— Courtney Lawrence was a former deputy assistant secretary for legislation in the Department of Health and Human Services in 2017 and 2018. She became a lobbyist for Cigna in 2018 and is listed as part of a team that has lobbied HHS, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and at least two other agencies. Cigna did not respond to a request for comment.— Shannon McGahn, the wife of former White House counsel Don McGahn, worked in 2017 and 2018 as a counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. She then joined the National Association of Realtors as its top lobbyist and is listed on disclosures as part of a team that has lobbied both houses of Congress, plus six agencies, including the Treasury Department. The Realtors association did not respond to a request for comment.— Jordan Stoick is the vice president of government relations at the National Association of Manufacturers. Stoick's biography on NAM's website indicates that he is ""NAM's lead lobbyist in Washington,"" where he started working after serving as a senior adviser in the Treasury Department.

Felder is listed on a disclosure from the first quarter of 2020 that shows she was part of a team that lobbied Congress and the White House.A spokeswoman for the firm said both Felder and Burr abide by the Trump administration's ethics rules, which limit their lobbying to the House and the Senate.""We are confident that our lobbyists are in compliance with all lobbying rules and applicable prohibitions and did not violate their Trump Administration pledge,"" spokeswoman Lara Day said in a statement.Public Citizen's Craig Holman, who himself is a registered lobbyist, said the group intends to file ethics complaints with the White House.

The trip also marks the president's first campaign rally in a political battleground state and second mega-event since his hiatus from the trail due to the coronavirus pandemic. The president's reelection campaign announced Sunday that the rally will take place at Portsmouth International Airport at 8 p.m. ET. According to a statement released by the Trump campaign, the outdoor event will feature ""ample access to hand sanitizer"" and all attendees ""will be provided a face mask that they are strongly encouraged to wear."" Trump campaign officials tell CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga that all attendees will also be required to pass a temperature check upon entry. Though the event will technically take place on federal land at the former site of Pease Air Force Base, the Trump campaign has coordinated with Governor Chris Sununu's office and state officials ahead of Saturday's event.There have been over 5,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases in New Hampshire, and more than 380 deaths, according to the state's Department of Public Health. Nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire residents disapprove of Mr. Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a University of New Hampshire survey released last month. In a survey of New Hampshire voters released last month, Mr. Trump trails Joe Biden. The presumptive Democratic nominee led the GOP incumbent 49% to 42% among registered voters, according to the Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll. Mr. Trump last visited the Granite State on February 10, which was the eve of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, for a crowded indoor rally in downtown Manchester. But it was in 2011 that then-real estate mogul Donald Trump first dropped into Portsmouth International Airport in a Trump-emblazoned black helicopter to explore a GOP primary bid, after pushing false rumors that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.The upcoming rally, just a few short miles from the Maine border, is expected to also draw supporters from the neighboring state. In 2016, Mr. Trump won Maine's 2nd congressional district, making him the first Republican to score Maine electoral votes since George H. W. Bush in 1988.

The decision from the Supreme Court comes just months ahead of the November general election, when voters will head to the polls to elect a president and vice president. ""The Constitution's text and the nation's history both support allowing a state to enforce an elector's pledge to support his party's nominee — and the state voters' choice — for president,"" Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court. Justice Sonia Sotomayor took no part in the decision of the dispute involving faithless electors in Colorado. The justices heard arguments in the disputes, the last of its term, via teleconference, as the court was forced to alter the format of arguments because of the coronavirus pandemic.STATE-BY-STATENEVADAThe Nevada State Democratic Party marked the launch of their coordinated campaign with ""virtual ice cream socials"" across the state over the weekend, with ""more than two dozen new field organizers"" hired in the past month as they race to ramp up their operation ahead of the general election, reports CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin.

The race was June 30, but due to the close initial margin and counting of mail ballots, the Associated Press called the race Monday afternoon. Cox captured 36.4% of the vote, while Huntsman had 34.6%. Cox is the favorite against Democrat law Professor Chris Harrison in November, since there hasn't been a Democratic governor since 1985.   CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGEIN THE HOUSENEW JERSEYOriginally slated for June 2 but postponed due to coronavirus, 12 House districts and one Senate seat will be on the ballot Tuesday in New Jersey.

Kennedy, an educator and wife of former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy, has the endorsements of Governor Phil Murphy and the Atlantic County Democratic Party, where one-third of voters reside. Harrison originally filed to primary Van Drew the week he voted against impeachment, and has been backed by six county chairs as well as Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker.  Another candidate in the running is Will Cunningham, a former congressional staffer who ran against Van Drew in the 2018 primary. New Jersey's 3rdDemocrat freshman Andy Kim is among the top targets for national Republicans, as Mr. Trump won this district by 6 points in 2016 before Kim narrowly flipped it in the midterms. In his district is a competitive GOP primary between engineer & lawyer David Richter and Kate Gibbs, a former elected official in Burlington County. Richter has loaned his campaign more money, but Gibbs has gotten support from outside groups such as the Defending Main Street PAC. New Jersey's 5thCongressman Josh Gottheimer is facing a challenge from the left with local Councilwoman Arati Kreibich. Kreibich has recently been backed by progressive stalwarts like Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders. Gottheimer, who is in his second term, has the backing of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Representatives Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey.  Gottheimer is currently co-chair of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, and Kreibich's campaign has looked to tie Gottheimer's focus on bipartisanship to the Republican party and Wall Street. Internal Gottheimer polls have him with a safe lead (62% to 21%), while Kreibich's internal polling shows her within a two-point margin after respondents were given more information about her platform and messaging.

The trip also marks the president's first campaign rally in a political battleground state and second mega-event since his hiatus from the trail due to the coronavirus pandemic. The president's reelection campaign announced Sunday that the rally will take place at Portsmouth International Airport at 8 p.m. ET. According to a statement released by the Trump campaign, the outdoor event will feature ""ample access to hand sanitizer"" and all attendees ""will be provided a face mask that they are strongly encouraged to wear."" Trump campaign officials tell CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga that all attendees will also be required to pass a temperature check upon entry. Though the event will technically take place on federal land at the former site of Pease Air Force Base, the Trump campaign has coordinated with Governor Chris Sununu's office and state officials ahead of Saturday's event.There have been over 5,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases in New Hampshire, and more than 380 deaths, according to the state's Department of Public Health. Nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire residents disapprove of Mr. Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a University of New Hampshire survey released last month. In a survey of New Hampshire voters released last month, Mr. Trump trails Joe Biden. The presumptive Democratic nominee led the GOP incumbent 49% to 42% among registered voters, according to the Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll. Mr. Trump last visited the Granite State on February 10, which was the eve of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, for a crowded indoor rally in downtown Manchester. But it was in 2011 that then-real estate mogul Donald Trump first dropped into Portsmouth International Airport in a Trump-emblazoned black helicopter to explore a GOP primary bid, after pushing false rumors that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.The upcoming rally, just a few short miles from the Maine border, is expected to also draw supporters from the neighboring state. In 2016, Mr. Trump won Maine's 2nd congressional district, making him the first Republican to score Maine electoral votes since George H. W. Bush in 1988. The Republican mayor of the Democratic-leaning city of Portsmouth, Rick Becksted, said he learned of the rally Sunday evening while watching the news and receiving email inquiries.      Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxFROM THE CANDIDATESJOE BIDENJoe Biden continues to chart a rhetorical contrast on Mr. Trump's declared ""war"" on cancel culture and the debate over racial equality in the country, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. The Biden campaign said it was clear after Friday's presidential address at Mount Rushmore that the ""divisive president … doesn't give a damn about anything but his own gain."" In his Independence Day message, Biden cited notes of history on slavery and the Civil War as examples of work still needed to fulfill the country's founding promise ""that all men [and women] are created equal."" The former vice president didn't appear anywhere publicly for the Fourth of July as his focus has been hyper cognizant on social distancing guidelines from both federal officials and officials in his home state of Delaware. Monday was another day without public appearances for Biden but his campaign announced their senior Florida ground game team, adding to the handful of battleground states where the Democrats have a physical staffing presence.  VEEPSTAKESELIZABETH WARRENTrail Markers                2020 Daily Trail Markers: Trump campaign schedules next rally to be outdoors                              Daily Trail Markers: Trump, Biden spar over jobs report as cases spike                              Daily Trail Markers: Wisconsin court won't expedite voter purge case                              Daily Trail Markers: Biden responds to Russian bounty intel reports                              2020 Daily Trail Markers: Supreme Court affirms abortion protections                          More in Trail Markers            Senator Elizabeth Warren is asking the country's largest food and beverage processors and farm operators to disclose what they're doing to protect their workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic, according to CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. In a letter to companies including Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz sent last week and released Monday, Warren along with Senators Jeff Merkley and Cory Booker wrote that failing to take substantial virus protection measures could have impacts beyond the health of their workers. ""Outbreaks in your facilities could threaten the broader food supply chain by further exacerbating existing labor shortages and reducing plant processing capacity,"" they wrote. ""Given the increasing consolidation of your industry, both producers and consumers could be left with limited alternatives, negatively affecting market opportunities for farmers and creating potential shortages for consumers."" In June, Warren and Booker had raised similar concerns about worker safety at meatpacking plants.KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMSAtlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced Monday on Twitter that she has tested positive for COVID-19. Bottoms later said in an interview on MSNBC that the news came as a shock to her, as she had only experienced mild allergy-like symptoms. ""This is startling for me because we've been so very careful. But certainly we are not immune."" Bottoms said in the interview and added, ""This is just a lesson to everyone. That you have to take every single symptom seriously as I see this growing list of symptoms. We can't assume that it's seasonal allergies. We can't assume that a mild cough, I get a seasonal allergies. We all need to be tested."" CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry reports that members of Bottoms' team have begun contact tracing measures.

According to the department, one person in Hillsborough County contracted Naegleria fowleri, which is a single-cell amoeba that attacks brain tissue and is usually fatal.Since 1962, there have been only 37 cases of Naegleria fowleri in Florida, according to the Department of Health. Only four people of the 145 known infected individuals in the U.S. have survived, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Naegleria fowleri   is contacted when contaminated water enters through a person's nose, and is found in warm freshwater such as lakers, rivers and hot springs, according to the CDC. Its peak season in Florida is in July, August and September, the Department of Health said, and it grows best at temperatures of 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxIt is also possible to contract Naegleria fowleri in swimming pools that are not properly chlorinated, or contaminated neti pots. A person can't contract Naegleria fowleri from drinking contaminated water, since it's only contracted through the nose.Symptoms of a Naegleria fowleri include severe frontal headache, fever, nausea and vomiting. Later symptoms can also include stiff neck, seizures, altered mental status, hallucinations and coma.Signs of infection typically start a few days after swimming or other nasal exposure to contaminated water. People die within 1 to 18 days after symptoms begin.

Traffic at retail and food establishments ticked upward for most of April and May as businesses reopened, emboldening people to venture outside, but it has started to drop again since mid-June, marking one of the first periods of deceleration since city and state lockdowns began. That's according to SafeGraph, which married anonymized cell phone data with its database of business listings and points of interest.Foot traffic reached its lowest point on April 14, when it was down 55% from January levels. Since that nadir, the nation has started easing up and there's been a gradual recovery. ""Now, that's starting to flatline and turn reverse course in the past few days,"" SafeGraph spokesperson Nick Singh said of the latest consumer patterns. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxData from restaurant reservation service OpenTable show a similar trend, with the level of sit-down dining patrons picking up in early June but dropping again at the end of the month.Experts say the data illustrate some of the economic consequences of reopening too quickly and how early efforts to jumpstart the economy appear to be backfiring. Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has for months warned the business community of these risks. Coronavirus: The Race To Respond                Stars remember Broadway actor Nick Cordero: ""What a light""                              Miami shuts down indoor dining and gyms as virus cases rise                              Atlanta mayor tests positive for coronavirus                              ICE says foreign students can't take online-only fall classes                              Only 40% of Harvard undergrads will return to campus this fall                          More in Coronavirus: The Race To Respond            ""If we end up coming out too soon and that results in substantial spread of the virus, that will be counterproductive in re-opening of economy. The more we box the virus in, the more space there is for us in society,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch in May.""A grand opening surge""It's not all linked to an uptick in COVID cases, though. Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said customers' brief returns to stores would have been short-lived no matter what. ""People were cooped up for a month, so as soon as they heard bars opening, they jumped back out,"" he said. ""It was a grand opening surge, and those things don't have legs."" SafeGraph measured the number of visits to millions of retail chains and mom-and-pop businesses from March through June and compared them to the number of visits during a baseline week in mid-January before the pandemic had taken hold in the U.S.On June 28, restaurants, stores and other establishments saw a 20% decrease in visitors compared to January. A week earlier, on June 21, they had been only 18% less busy. This recent dip in traffic is even more acute in states suffering from the sharpest increases in coronavirus cases as a result of governments relaxing social distancing measures and allowing businesses to reopen more fully — by permitting, for example, restaurants to seat customers inside.  Retail stores face uphill battle during pande...01:57Case numbers in Florida rose most sharply between June 22 and June 27, when they hit 9,019 new cases in one day, compared to 3,200 new cases on June 22, according to Johns Hopkins University's coronavirus case tracker. Bars in Florida saw a 5% percent drop in foot traffic over the same period, according to the SafeGraph data. Sit-down restaurants in the Sunshine State saw similar declines in patron counts. These data show what pubic health experts and economists alike have tried to impress upon the public — that containing the virus and reviving the economy go hand-in-hand. A separate set of credit card transaction data also show that residents in states with newly rising coronavirus case counts are making fewer visits to restaurants, stores and other places where people typically spend money.A report from Facteus, which collects anonymized data from financial companies and card issuers, shows that year-over-year growth in overall spending started decelerating on June 25 in the U.S.. Retail spending growth dropped 14 percentage points between June 21 and June 28, marking the biggest negative change in week-to-week growth during the recovery so far. ""The retail space has been trending very high over the past couple of months driven by e-commerce, but we have seen a deceleration in that. It's gone back down to prior levels to where it was in the April and early-May time frame,"" said Steve Shaw, a spokesperson for Facteus. Average retail spending growth was up 28% in mid-May, as a result, in part, of Americans receiving stimulus checks directed by the CARES Act. ""Obviously, they were not spending it on entertainment and travel, so they were using it in the retail space,"" Shaw added.The deceleration is likely due to a combination of factors, including consumers' stimulus checks running out as well as additional unemployment aid ending. It also appears to be tied to the virus' resurgence in states like Arizona, Florida and Texas, where infection rates are spiking again after they abandoned social distancing precautions. Growth rates in all three states are trending lower than the broader economy, according to Facteus' analysis, perhaps because many residents have become fearful of going out. Texas lags by about 4% compared to the rest of the U.S., while Florida lags by 5% and Arizona by 7%. ""It's only one week, but it's certainly something that we are going to be focusing on and paying attention to,"" Shaw said.Cohen of Columbia Business School predicts a ""pretty wild ride downward"" for the foreseeable future. ""If you ask me when I think this is going to be 'over,' I think it's way out in 2022 when the health issue has been solved or is under control and the extraordinary economic damage this virus has created has begun to ameliorate,"" he said. "

Daniels changed it to ""I get up in the morning. I get down in the afternoon.""""I guess I've mellowed in my old age,"" Daniels said in 1998.Otherwise, though, he rarely backed down from in-your-face lyrics.His ""Simple Man"" in 1990 suggested lynching drug dealers and using child abusers as alligator bait.His ""In America"" in 1980 told this country's enemies to ""go straight to hell.""Such tough talk earned him guest spots on ""Politically Incorrect,"" the G.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/companies-boycotting-facebook-ads-why-different-than-other-boycott/,More advertisers fleeing Facebook as boycott grows,['Irina Ivanova'],"['June 30, 2020']","A growing number of major advertisers are abandoning Facebook amid criticism the social media company is letting hateful or false posts go unchecked.Chipotle, HP, Pfizer and Puma are the latest to pull their ads from Facebook. They join a list of major brands including Adidas, Clorox, Coca-Cola, Conagra, Denny's, Ford, Starbucks, Unilever and scores of smaller businesses that have halted advertising on the platform. A pledge by Mark Zuckerberg on Friday to label rule-breaking posts has done little to mollify advertisers. In all, more than 100 brands have pledged to boycott the social media giant, while prominent critics including Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have also thrown their influential weight behind the boycott, according to reports. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxThe campaign also appears to have dented Facebook's stock. Its shares have dropped roughly 8% since the boycott started gaining steam last week, slashing $53 billion off the company's stock market value. Although Facebook has faced plenty of boycotts in the past, the latest campaign — spearheaded by leading civil rights groups such as the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League — could have more staying power, analysts say.""What's different this time is we have a bunch of significant large brands that are getting on board, and we have a number of large brands that are not getting on board with the boycott but taking action of their own beyond what the boycott asks for,"" said Nicole Perrin, principal analyst at eMarketer.

The consumer goods giant, which owns brands including Dove, Hellman's and Lipton, said it would stop advertising on Twitter as well as Facebook and Instagram until at least year-end. Unilever cited ""divisiveness"" on the platforms in its announcement that it would remove its advertising, but did not mention the boycott campaign led by the civil rights groups. Facebook to start labeling rule-breaking post...01:50Neither did Coca-Cola, which is pulling all social ads for a month, nor Clorox, which promised to stay off Facebook until December. Similarly, Starbucks merely announced its intention to stand against online hate-speech, saying in part: ""[Both] business leaders and policy makers need to come together to affect real change.""For Perrin, this is a sign that big brands could be getting uncomfortable with social media sites or user-generated content in general. Speaking of Unilever, she said, ""I thought this was an example of a brand expressing discomfort with being in places where people are essentially expressing in free political discussion ahead of an election. There was no way that there wasn't going to be division.""Asking for total harmony on the platform ""would be difficult to impossible for Facebook to deliver,"" she said, and would require ""fundamental changes to the way user-generated platforms operate, and how much they allow people to say."" Bottom-line impact?Big advertisers like Unilever — which spent just over $8 billion on marketing last year — as well as Clorox and Coca-Cola can help drive broader change in the media world. But when it comes to Facebook, their exodus doesn't do much to affect its bottom line. More than 8 million advertisers use the platform, according to eMarketer. The top 100 advertisers on Facebook contribute just 6% of its revenue, according to Pathmatics data cited by analysts at Raymond James, and no advertiser is irreplaceable. ""[S]ocial platforms are typically able to replace lost advertisers with other advertisers given the auction dynamics of the platforms,"" Aaron Kessler, an analyst with the investment bank, wrote in a note to investors.There are other reasons for big-name brands to avoid social media, Perrin noted. For many well-known consumer brands, the ability to target niche groups that Facebook offers may not be as important as it would be to smaller businesses. And, because of the coronavirus pandemic, advertisers were already looking to cut spending.Trump lauds Facebook, slams Twitter07:50Still, if there's a surefire way of getting Facebook's attention, vocal complaints by big advertisers rank high. Advertising still represents the vast majority of Facebook's revenue, and media reports indicate that senior executives at the company are working hard to keep ad buyers happy. The company's head of trust and safety policy recently acknowledged its ""trust deficit,"" according to the Financial Times.The campaigners have indicated that yanking U.S. ad spending is just a starting point. The CEO of Common Sense Media, one of the groups behind the Facebook ad boycott, told Axios the focus was shifting overseas, where many brands put their marketing dollars."

Ancient skeletons were found in the narrow, twisting labyrinths of now-submerged sinkhole caves.Since skeletal remains like ""Naia,"" a young woman who died 13,000 years ago, were found over the last 15 years, archaeologists have wondered how they wound up in the then-dry caves. About 8,000 years ago, rising sea levels flooded the caves, known as cenotes, around the Caribbean coast resort of Tulum.Had these early inhabitants fallen in, or did they go down intentionally seeking shelter, food or water? Nine sets of human skeletal remains have been found in the underwater caves, whose passages can be barely big enough to squeeze through.Para obtener más información sobre Sagitario / La Mina en español, siga este enlace a nuestra pagina...Posted by El Centro Investigador del Sistema Acuífero de Quintana Roo A.C. on Friday, July 3, 2020Recent discoveries of about 900 meters of ocher mines suggest they may have had a more powerful attraction. The discovery of remains of human-set fires, stacked mining debris, simple stone tools, navigational aids and digging sites suggest humans went into the caves around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, seeking iron-rich red ocher, which early peoples in the Americas prized for decoration and rituals.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxSuch pigments were used in cave paintings, rock art, burials and other structures among early peoples around the globe.The early miners apparently brought torches or firewood to light their work, and broke off pieces of stalagmites to pound out the ocher. They left smoke marks on the roof of the caves that are still visible today.""While Naia added to the understanding of the ancestry, growth and development of these early Americans, little was known about why she and her contemporaries took the risk to enter the maze of caves,"" wrote researchers from the Research Center for the Aquifer System of Quintana Roo, known as CINDAQ for its initials in Spanish.

The early miners may have removed tons of ocher, which, when ground to a paste, can be used to color hair, skin, rocks or hides in varying shades of red.""Now we know that ancient humans did not risk entering this maze of caves just to get water or flee from predators, but that they also entered them to mine,"" Junco Sanchez said.However, James Chatters, forensic anthropologist, archaeologist, and paleontologist with Applied Paleoscience, a consulting firm in Bothell, Washington, noted that none of the pre-Maya human remains in the caves were found directly in the mining areas.Dr. Spencer Pelton, a professor at the University of Wyoming and the state archaeologist, has excavated a slightly older ocher mine at the Powars II site near Hartville, Wyoming.Pelton agreed that among the first inhabitants of the Americas, ocher had an especially powerful attraction.Red ocher mining ""seems especially important during the first period of human colonization ... you find it on tools, floors, hunt sites,"" Pelton said. ""It's a substance of great power ... everybody likes shiny red things.""""It gives them a reason"" to go into the caves, Pelton said, adding: ""Considering the massive scale of this mining, it's the first thing I would go for.""The caves provide a well-preserved environment and are where one of the oldest sets of human remains found in the Americas, a young woman nicknamed ""Naia,"" was discovered in 2007.Chatters said Naia ""most likely died from a 30 meter fall from the dark cave tunnel"" onto the floor of a chamber below."

Felder is listed on a disclosure from the first quarter of 2020 that shows she was part of a team that lobbied Congress and the White House.A spokeswoman for the firm said both Felder and Burr abide by the Trump administration's ethics rules, which limit their lobbying to the House and the Senate.""We are confident that our lobbyists are in compliance with all lobbying rules and applicable prohibitions and did not violate their Trump Administration pledge,"" spokeswoman Lara Day said in a statement.Public Citizen's Craig Holman, who himself is a registered lobbyist, said the group intends to file ethics complaints with the White House. But he's not optimistic that they will lead to anything. Last year, he filed more than 30 complaints, all of which were either ignored or rejected.""There does not appear to be anyone who is enforcing the executive order,"" Holman said."
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-boycott-advertisers-no-change/,"Facebook ad boycott is a tactical retreat for companies, not a cause",['Irina Ivanova'],"['July 1, 2020']","A range of major companies have have been quick to join an advertising boycott against Facebook amid concerns about hate speech and misinformation on the world's most popular social media site. Yet the move reflects more of a tactical retreat from the platform, experts say, with brands under enormous public pressure to take a stand against racism.Indeed, many of the 200 brands that committed to pause their marketing on Facebook were already likely to do that given that July, the month marked for the boycott, typically sees low spending on ads.  On top of that, the coronavirus-induced economic freeze has many   advertisers looking for a reason to cut back.""My opinion is  those  people were going to cut advertising anyway because of COVID,""  said  Laura Martin, an equity analyst who covers Facebook at investment bank Needham. The pandemic has not  only reduced how  much consumers spend, but it has changed behavior to  make other forms of  advertising, such as Google or connected TV ads,  more attractive, she added.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox""Facebook's competitive advantage is  reaching people on  their mobile devices, and everyone's sitting at  home right now,"" she  said. ""You can reach people at home, so you don't  need Facebook so much.  It's an easy way for companies to boycott [the  platform] without  hurting their bottom line.""One thing is for certain: Facebook's top ad spenders aren't budging. According to data from marketing intelligence firm Pathmatics, the 50 biggest advertisers on Facebook spent a total of $1.4 billion on ads in the first half of the year. Of those 50, only one — Starbucks — has joined the boycott. On Facebook-owned Instagram, five of the top 50 spenders have joined the boycott, representing 10% of the $455 million the platform's 50 highest spenders paid for advertising through June. Major spenders still on board include Disney, which spent $225 million on both platforms in the prior six months, Procter & Gamble and the U.S. Census Bureau, according to Pathmatics.Facebook removes Trump ads over symbol00:38Gogi Gupta, founder  of digital marketing agency Gupta Media, noted that Facebook is less strategically important for many of the companies distancing themselves from the company.                                Trending News                                    FDA warns about 5 additional toxic hand sanitizers                              Kanye West's Yeezy got millions in small business loans                              Treasury names small businesses receiving PPP loans                              Trump-connected lobbyists reap windfall in COVID-19 boom                              A second stimulus check? Here's how much you could get              ""If  you take  Coca-Cola, their brand is so strong, their distribution  network is so  strong, that if you take them out of Facebook it doesn't  change much,""  he said. Smaller companies, especially direct-to-consumer  brands like  Harry's or Casper, are much less likely to yank their ads because  their social-media  advertising is crucial to their sales. ""They spend a dollar to make six dollars, and  the minute  you turn that off, the impact to them is six times worse than  it is for  Facebook,"" he said. Pennies on the dollarDespite the attention the boycott has garnered, meanwhile, Wall Street appears unconcerned. Facebook's stock has risen 12% since Monday, indicating investor confidence that it will weather the scandal, like many others, with barely a dent to its bottom line.The boycott has so far cost Facebook about $150 million, Oppenheimer estimated. While that's a sizable figure for many businesses, it represents less than 1% of the $17 billion in ad revenue Facebook pulled in during the first quarter alone. If Facebook's top 100 advertisers all dropped off the platform, that would shave just 1% off its annual revenue, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak. Yet as of Wednesday, many of the top 100 continue to advertise on Facebook Those companies include AT&T, ViacomCBS (the corporate parent of CBSNews.com), Disney,  Home Depot, The New York Times, Walmart and Wix. Procter & Gamble, the world's top buyer of  advertising, has so far stopped short of pulling its ads off the platform,despite a recent promise to avoid ""hateful, discriminatory, denigrating or derogatory"" content. With about 8 million advertisers, Facebook is well-insulated from most customer complaints. Moreover, its auction model for selling ads means that  any advertiser that departs is easily replaced with another. ""We really think that it is important that advertisers exercise their brand virtues through advertising and where they choose to spend those dollars,"" Gupta said. But when it comes to boycotting Facebook, he said, ""It's hard for me to imagine this will have much impact.""Big tech companies expand amid crisis06:44While the Anti-Defamation League, one of the campaign's sponsors, has called the boycott ""a tremendous success so far,"" data indicate that new advertisers are coming in to replace those leaving. Gupta Media's analysis shows that the cost of Facebook ads has steadily risen since a low point in late March — and is now at the same level it was last year.For many brands, in other words, Facebook is just too good to give up. ""[M]ost advertisers cannot afford to pause [Facebook and Instagram] campaigns for more than a month given how effective FB is compared to other platforms,"" Oppenheimer analysts wrote in a research note.So while brands may want to boycott Facebook for longer to show they're in sync with their customer's values, Needham's Martin believes they will only do so for as long as COVID lockdowns continue. ""Right now  it doesn't cost [advertisers] anything to take a political stance here, but the  minute consumers leave their homes they're going to need Facebook,"" she said ""So economic  realities will overshadow their political goals."""

But if you still need more time to get your return in, filing for an extension is quick and straightforward.As in previous years, filing for an extension gives taxpayers until October 15 to get their tax return in. You can file an extension via commercial tax software, IRS Free File or even by physically mailing in Form 4868. The IRS strongly encourages people to file electronically, and offers a number of ways to do so via its website.

According to the IRS, ""State filing and payment deadlines vary and are not always the same as the Federal filing and payment deadline."" Some states will automatically give you an extension on your state taxes if you receive a federal extension. In other states, you'll need to request an extension separately.

Bush officials form super PAC to support Joe Biden,['Jason Silverstein'],"['July 2, 2020']","Officials who worked for former President George W. Bush have formed a super PAC supporting Joe Biden for president. It's the latest instance of old-guard Republicans uniting to not only oppose President Trump, but also actively support his Democratic rival in November.The group launched Wednesday under the name ""43 Alumni for Biden,"" referencing Bush's status as the 43rd U.S. president. It will raise money to support Biden and says it also plans to launch video campaigns and get-out-the-vote efforts to mobilize ""disenchanted GOP voters"" against the incumbent Republican president.""Earlier this summer, having seen far too many days filled with chaos emanating from the highest levels of government, we knew it was time to take a stand,"" the group says on its website.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox""Bound by our shared work experience and a belief in a brighter tomorrow, we endorse Joe Biden for President. Political differences may remain among us, but we look forward to a time when civil, honest and robust policy discussions are the order of the day. Our democracy is at stake.""The group says it includes Cabinet secretaries and senior officials from the Bush administration, but it has not disclosed a full list of its members. Mr. Bush himself is not involved in the group, and as a super PAC, it cannot work directly with the Biden campaign.Reuters first reported on the group's formation and said hundreds of former Bush officials were on board.

They include Republican Voters Against Trump, which is running a multimillion-dollar ad campaign targeting swing states voters, and the Lincoln Project, which was co-founded by George Conway, the husband of Trump White House adviser Kellyanne Conway. Lincoln Project targets Trump in new ads05:14"

That prompted Webb and her colleagues to conduct a study that asked: When patients arrive at the emergency room, who was being tested for COVID-19?""What we found was that we were disproportionately ordering more tests for people who were White, despite the fact that it was the people of color who are disproportionately affected across our country,"" Webb said. ""Of the tests that we were ordering for people of color, those were coming back positive at a higher rate.""Coronavirus tests are just one example of how Black people often fare worse under the current health care system.Black people are significantly more likely than White people to suffer from chronic health conditions like diabetes and asthma, according to the CDC. They also have the highest mortality rate for all cancers compared to any other racial group, and an infant mortality rate that's nearly twice the national average.Research has also found that Black women are 42% more likely to die of breast cancer than White women, and that Black individuals are at higher risk of both developing and dying from colon cancer. Black men are more than 1.5 times more likely to get prostate cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while both Black men and women are more than twice as likely to develop myeloma, cancer of plasma cells. Black women are also roughly three times more likely than White women to die during childbirth, according to the CDC.                          Li Cohen/CBS News                      Internal medicine and public health doctor Michelle Morse, an assistant professor at Harvard University, said she saw that dynamic at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She said that around 2016, the hospital noticed a pattern in their emergency room that spanned at least a decade: Black and Latinx patients coming in for heart failure were more often admitted for treatment by general medicine providers than cardiology specialists. White patients, comparatively, were frequently treated by specialists who could provide better care.Heart failure patients who saw general providers, Morse explained, had a higher hospital readmission rate than those treated by specialists.""Often what happens is that Black and Brown patients get blamed for their outcomes not being as good as White folks,"" Morse said. ""So it again reinforces the fact that a lot of the racial inequities...are actually about the social conditions and the policies, not about the behavior, or compliance with medications, or biology, or genes, or DNA of Black and Latinx patients.""Since the study, Morse said the hospital developed a program called Adaptive Leaders for Racial Justice that teaches clinicians about antiracism and clinical medicine. They have also launched research to find out what drives triage decisions, and to find ways to improve the quality of heart failure care. ""We hope other institutions and clinicians will be equally committed to addressing inequities in their own contexts, systems, and care settings,"" Dr. Eldrin Lewis, director of the Cardiovascular Clerkship Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said in a press release. ""Ongoing institutional insistence on self-critique and recognition of the pervasiveness of structural racism and bias will increase the likelihood of success in achieving health equity at all U.S. institutions.""Webb explained that while many doctors tend to scold Black patients for inadequate health care, systemic issues are largely to blame. Economic inequality is part of that. Black people living in many major U.S. cities earn at least $30,000 less than their White counterparts, and are significantly more likely to be unemployed, live in poverty, and not own a home; according to the CDC, they are also less likely to be able to afford medical care. Black patients tend to go to the worst hospitals in the country, where patients are more likely to die from heart attacks or pneumonia, a 2011 study found.""Those years of not having care or not having access to medications or having insurance so that you can have a primary care doctor or, on a basic level, not having access to healthy foods or clean water, we see the manifestation of that in the emergency department,"" Webb said. ""And it's devastating to watch.""A 2018 study suggested that these disparities are at least partially linked to doctors believing that Black patients are less likely to improve or adhere to recommended treatments. Doctors also tend to believe Black patients are less responsible for their health, the study found. This belief, the study said, affects what treatments doctors provide.Jessica Simpson, who is Black, is a second-year medical student at Loyola University Chicago. She said she deals with this kind of racism daily interacting with non-Black medical students, and the school itself. She said implicit biases, such as discounting a patient's pain, are judgments and assumptions many people, including med students, don't realize they have. ""By nature, we develop social biases as a byproduct of just the normal function of our brains,"" she said. ""It's easier for our brains to label people, places, things, experiences, just because we have we live in a complex world ... so social biases create this lens that we have, for what we notice, and how we interpret the world.""Medical students at Loyola University Chicago organized a campaign in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.                         Courtesy of Jessica Simpson                      Simpson said many of these biases begin in medical school. She explained medical schools do not thoroughly teach the history and context of race in medicine, and said there is a lack of diversity to help facilitate the conversation.Black students tend to make up a small portion of medical school classes. In 2018-2019, just 1,238 out of the more than 19,900 med school graduates were Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.This, Simpson said, can impact the types of questions physicians ask their patients and the treatment they provide.In a 2016 study, researchers found many doctors and med students believe there are biological differences between Black and White people, and that Black people are not as sensitive to pain as their White counterparts. Because of this, the study said, Black people often receive inadequate pain treatment. ""It's difficult that we're still having to talk about this,"" Simpson said, ""but I also have hope."" Simpson started a chapter of the national organization White Coats for Black Lives at her school after the murder of George Floyd, and said addressing and being aware of racial inequalities — both in health care and beyond — is ""imperative"" for future physicians. ""We can no longer afford to be silent regarding matters of oppression,"" she told CBS News. ""It's our responsibility to learn about that and to learn about our own implicit biases in order to provide the same compassionate, patient-centered care to all of our patients, regardless of their race and ethnicity.""Doctors trying to fight bias in health care04:37Dr. Cameron Webb, University of Virginia Director of Health Policy and Equity and Leigh-Ann's husband, told CBS News that to change discriminatory outcomes, health care has to reprioritize and incentivize doctors to focus on quality care, not quantity care. Webb, the Democratic candidate in Virginia's 5th Congressional district, would be the first Black physician elected to Congress if he wins in November. ""Right now, it's very fee-for-service — you just do more things, you get more money,"" he said, adding that value-based contracts would ensure patients receive better quality and more affordable care. ""It really moves hospitals into thinking holistically about what makes patients sick, and invest a smart investment and making communities that are designed for people to be healthier. This kind of redesign disproportionately will benefit minority and lower-income communities.""""There's that old quote from Dr. Martin Luther King, that 'of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane,'"" Webb said. ""This is one of those moments when we're trying to root out injustice...this is the moment to lean into that work, and to recognize this is what it looks like to make a better nation.""Black individuals who have experienced racial bias and discrimination in health care say without more everyday action, the movement is ""like a Band-Aid.""""It soothes the soul, but my wound is still very much open,"" Jada said. ""It's like you just pat me on the back and it's like I'm here for you with your cut, but you're not actively healing the cut.""Malaika Pedzayi-Ferguson said that for White doctors, and White people in general, ""the problem starts when the activism stops with your sign that you posted, when you're not addressing the ways you contribute to these systems.""""It's good to address the bare minimum of, yes, Black lives matter,"" Pedzayi-Ferguson said.

Black men are more than 1.5 times more likely to get prostate cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while both Black men and women are more than twice as likely to develop myeloma, cancer of plasma cells. Black women are also roughly three times more likely than White women to die during childbirth, according to the CDC.                          Li Cohen/CBS News                      Internal medicine and public health doctor Michelle Morse, an assistant professor at Harvard University, said she saw that dynamic at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She said that around 2016, the hospital noticed a pattern in their emergency room that spanned at least a decade: Black and Latinx patients coming in for heart failure were more often admitted for treatment by general medicine providers than cardiology specialists. White patients, comparatively, were frequently treated by specialists who could provide better care.Heart failure patients who saw general providers, Morse explained, had a higher hospital readmission rate than those treated by specialists.""Often what happens is that Black and Brown patients get blamed for their outcomes not being as good as White folks,"" Morse said. ""So it again reinforces the fact that a lot of the racial inequities...are actually about the social conditions and the policies, not about the behavior, or compliance with medications, or biology, or genes, or DNA of Black and Latinx patients.""Since the study, Morse said the hospital developed a program called Adaptive Leaders for Racial Justice that teaches clinicians about antiracism and clinical medicine. They have also launched research to find out what drives triage decisions, and to find ways to improve the quality of heart failure care. ""We hope other institutions and clinicians will be equally committed to addressing inequities in their own contexts, systems, and care settings,"" Dr. Eldrin Lewis, director of the Cardiovascular Clerkship Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said in a press release. ""Ongoing institutional insistence on self-critique and recognition of the pervasiveness of structural racism and bias will increase the likelihood of success in achieving health equity at all U.S. institutions.""Webb explained that while many doctors tend to scold Black patients for inadequate health care, systemic issues are largely to blame. Economic inequality is part of that. Black people living in many major U.S. cities earn at least $30,000 less than their White counterparts, and are significantly more likely to be unemployed, live in poverty, and not own a home; according to the CDC, they are also less likely to be able to afford medical care. Black patients tend to go to the worst hospitals in the country, where patients are more likely to die from heart attacks or pneumonia, a 2011 study found.""Those years of not having care or not having access to medications or having insurance so that you can have a primary care doctor or, on a basic level, not having access to healthy foods or clean water, we see the manifestation of that in the emergency department,"" Webb said. ""And it's devastating to watch.""A 2018 study suggested that these disparities are at least partially linked to doctors believing that Black patients are less likely to improve or adhere to recommended treatments. Doctors also tend to believe Black patients are less responsible for their health, the study found. This belief, the study said, affects what treatments doctors provide.Jessica Simpson, who is Black, is a second-year medical student at Loyola University Chicago. She said she deals with this kind of racism daily interacting with non-Black medical students, and the school itself. She said implicit biases, such as discounting a patient's pain, are judgments and assumptions many people, including med students, don't realize they have. ""By nature, we develop social biases as a byproduct of just the normal function of our brains,"" she said. ""It's easier for our brains to label people, places, things, experiences, just because we have we live in a complex world ... so social biases create this lens that we have, for what we notice, and how we interpret the world.""Medical students at Loyola University Chicago organized a campaign in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.                         Courtesy of Jessica Simpson                      Simpson said many of these biases begin in medical school. She explained medical schools do not thoroughly teach the history and context of race in medicine, and said there is a lack of diversity to help facilitate the conversation.Black students tend to make up a small portion of medical school classes. In 2018-2019, just 1,238 out of the more than 19,900 med school graduates were Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.This, Simpson said, can impact the types of questions physicians ask their patients and the treatment they provide.In a 2016 study, researchers found many doctors and med students believe there are biological differences between Black and White people, and that Black people are not as sensitive to pain as their White counterparts. Because of this, the study said, Black people often receive inadequate pain treatment. ""It's difficult that we're still having to talk about this,"" Simpson said, ""but I also have hope."" Simpson started a chapter of the national organization White Coats for Black Lives at her school after the murder of George Floyd, and said addressing and being aware of racial inequalities — both in health care and beyond — is ""imperative"" for future physicians. ""We can no longer afford to be silent regarding matters of oppression,"" she told CBS News. ""It's our responsibility to learn about that and to learn about our own implicit biases in order to provide the same compassionate, patient-centered care to all of our patients, regardless of their race and ethnicity.""Doctors trying to fight bias in health care04:37Dr. Cameron Webb, University of Virginia Director of Health Policy and Equity and Leigh-Ann's husband, told CBS News that to change discriminatory outcomes, health care has to reprioritize and incentivize doctors to focus on quality care, not quantity care. Webb, the Democratic candidate in Virginia's 5th Congressional district, would be the first Black physician elected to Congress if he wins in November. ""Right now, it's very fee-for-service — you just do more things, you get more money,"" he said, adding that value-based contracts would ensure patients receive better quality and more affordable care. ""It really moves hospitals into thinking holistically about what makes patients sick, and invest a smart investment and making communities that are designed for people to be healthier. This kind of redesign disproportionately will benefit minority and lower-income communities.""""There's that old quote from Dr. Martin Luther King, that 'of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane,'"" Webb said. ""This is one of those moments when we're trying to root out injustice...this is the moment to lean into that work, and to recognize this is what it looks like to make a better nation.""Black individuals who have experienced racial bias and discrimination in health care say without more everyday action, the movement is ""like a Band-Aid.""""It soothes the soul, but my wound is still very much open,"" Jada said. ""It's like you just pat me on the back and it's like I'm here for you with your cut, but you're not actively healing the cut.""Malaika Pedzayi-Ferguson said that for White doctors, and White people in general, ""the problem starts when the activism stops with your sign that you posted, when you're not addressing the ways you contribute to these systems.""""It's good to address the bare minimum of, yes, Black lives matter,"" Pedzayi-Ferguson said. ""If that's where we're starting with people in the medical field then they need to start addressing, are they treating these Black lives like they matter?"""

In April last year, a court in southern India banned the app over complaints that it exposed children to sexual predators, cyberbullies, and pornographic content. But the court lifted the ban in just one week, after assurances from company representatives that they had fixed loopholes. Among the dozens of other apps banned by India on Monday are SHAREit and UC Browser. File sharing platform SHAREit is the third most active app in India after messenging service WhatsApp and Facebook, with more than 400 million downloads. UC Browser, owned by Alibaba Group's UCWeb, is the second most used web browser in India after Google Chrome.   Other banned Chinese apps include social networking, video editing, photo editing, and e-commerce platforms, and some games and other tools.

Senior Indian and Chinese military officers met again Tuesday morning, for the third time in two weeks, but no details of the meeting were immediately released. Deadly clash at India-China border01:46Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Sunday that his government had given a ""befitting response"" to China. Amid widespread calls in the country for a boycott of Chinese products, Modi said Indians would, ""buy local and be vocal for local, and this will help India become stronger."" While the government hasn't imposed any official restrictions on Chinese goods, the rhetoric is having an impact.Indian Railways has cancelled a signalling project contract with a Chinese company, and all public companies have reportedly been asked not to issue new contracts to Chinese firms. One federal minister even called for people to boycott restaurants serving Chinese food, which is popular across India.But in spite of the calls, China is India's second-largest trading partner after the U.S., and some analysts in the country have warned it could be difficult for New Delhi to ween a fast developing nation off Chinese goods.

While the world's been focused on other crises, an alarming study was released warning that species extinction is now progressing so fast that the consequences of ""biological annihilation"" may soon be ""unimaginable.""Dr. Jane Goodall, the world-renowned conservationist, desperately wants the world to pay attention to what she sees as the greatest threat to humanity's existence.CBS News recently spoke to Goodall over a video conference call and asked her questions about the state of our planet. Her soft-spoken grace somehow helped cushion what was otherwise extremely sobering news: ""I just know that if we carry on with business as usual, we're going to destroy ourselves. It would be the end of us, as well as life on Earth as we know it,"" warned Goodall.Dr. Jane Goodall at a reception in honor of Disney Conservation Funds 20th anniversary on April 18, 2016 in Orlando, Florida.                        Gustavo Caballero / Getty Images                      What follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation. Jeff Berardelli: Destruction of nature is causing some really big concerns around the world. One that comes to the forefront right now is emergent diseases like COVID-19. Can you describe how destruction of the environment contributes to this?Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxDr. Jane Goodall: Well, the thing is, we brought this on ourselves because the scientists that have been studying these so-called zoonotic diseases that jump from an animal to a human have been predicting something like this for so long. As we chop down at stake tropical rainforest, with its rich biodiversity, we are eating away the habitats of millions of animals, and many of them are being pushed into greater contact with humans. We're driving deeper and deeper, making roads throughout the habitat, which again brings people and animals in contact with each other. People are hunting the animals and selling the meat, or trafficking the infants, and all of this is creating environments which are perfect for a virus or a bacteria to cross that species barrier and sometimes, like COVID-19, it becomes very contagious and we're suffering from it. But we know if we don't stop destroying the environment and disrespecting animals — we're hunting them, killing them, eating them; killing and eating chimpanzees in Central Africa led to HIV/AIDS — there will be another one. It's inevitable.How environmental abuse has lead to epidemics...06:04Do you fear that the next [pandemic] will be a lot worse than this one?Climate Change                Jane Goodall: If humans don't change ""we're going to destroy ourselves""                              100.4° Arctic record confirmed; Earth may be warmest in 12,000 years                              ""We are at a crossroads"": Lawmakers unveil climate change plan                              Arctic records its hottest temperature ever                              2020 likely to be the warmest year on record globally                          More in Climate Change            Well, we've been lucky with this one because, although it's incredibly infectious, the percentage of people who die is relatively low. Mostly they recover and hopefully then build up some immunity. But supposing the next one is just as contagious and has a percentage of deaths like Ebola, for example, this would have an even more devastating effect on humanity than this one.I think people have a hard time connecting these, what may look like chance events, with our interactions and relationship with nature. Can you describe to people why the way that we treat the natural world is so important? Well, first of all, it's not just leading to zoonotic diseases, and there are many of them. The destruction of the environment is also contributing to the climate crisis, which tends to be put in second place because of our panic about the pandemic. We will get through the pandemic like we got through World War II, World War I, and the horrors following the World Trade towers being destroyed. But climate change is a very real existential threat to humankind and we don't have that long to slow it down. Intensive farming, where we're destroying the land slowly with the chemical poisons, and the monocultures — which can be wiped out by a disease because there is no variation of crops being grown — is leading to habitat destruction. It's leading to the creation of more CO2 through fossil fuels, methane gas and other greenhouse gas [released] by digestion from the billions of domestic animals. It's pretty grim. We need to realize we're part of the environment, that we need the natural world. We depend on it. We can't go on destroying. We've got to somehow understand that we're not separated from it, we are all intertwined. Harm nature, harm ourselves.If we continue on with business as usual, what do you fear the outcome will be?Well, if we continue with business as usual, we're going to come to the point of no return.  At a certain point the ecosystems of the world will just give up and collapse and that's the end of us eventually too. What about our children? We're still bringing children into the world — what a grim future is theirs to look forward to. It's pretty shocking but my hope is, during this pandemic, with people trapped inside, factories closed down temporarily, and people not driving, it has cleared up the atmosphere amazingly. The people in the big cities can look up at the night sky and sea stars are bright, not looking through a layer of pollution. So when people emerge [from the pandemic] they're not going to want to go back to the old polluted days. How the pandemic is improving air quality02:23Now, in some countries there's not much they can do about it. But if enough of them, a groundswell becomes bigger and bigger and bigger [and] people say: ""No I don't want to go down this road. We want to find a different, green economy. We don't want to always put economic development ahead of protecting the environment. We care about the future. We care about the health of the planet. We need nature,"" maybe in the end the big guys will have to listen.I often think our economic future, which is always put at the forefront, is actually dependent upon our ecological future. Without an ecological future, there is not going to be any economic growth. Would you agree? Absolutely. I mean, it's all been said again and again, but fossil fuels are not infinite, they will come to an end, leading to a lot more destruction of the environment for sure. Forests and natural resources are not infinite and yet we're treating them as though they are, and in some places using them up more quickly than nature can replenish them. We have to have a different kind of economy, we need a different way of thinking about what is success. Is it just about having more and more money, more and more stuff, being able to show off to your friends, and the wasteful society we live in? We waste clothes, we waste food, we waste laptops and cellphones. That pollutes the environment. So we've got to think differently, haven't we?So what do we do? Right now our worldview is based on GDP. You suggest that we think of it in a different way. So do you have a suggestion of how we rate our success other than GDP?I'm not an economist. I just know that if we carry on with business as usual, we're going to destroy ourselves. It would be the end of us, as well as life on Earth as we know it.So one thing we can do, those of us in affluent societies can almost all do with a bit less. We have a very unsustainable lifestyle. You can't really blame people, they grew up into it. But if you went through World War II like I did, when you took nothing for granted, one square of chocolate for a week is what we had and everything was rationed. So, you appreciate it. We never wasted even an ounce of food; not like today. Then, we also have to alleviate poverty. Because if you're really poor you destroy the environment, you cut down the last trees to make land to grow more food for your family, or fish the last fish. Or if you're in an urban area you buy the cheapest junk food. You don't have the luxury of asking: how is this made, did it harm the environment, did it lead to the suffering of animals like in the factory farms, is it cheap because of child slave labor? You just have to buy the cheapest in order to survive. Then the third thing, which nobody wants to talk about, but nevertheless ... there are approximately 7.8 billion of us on the planet today and already in some places we're using up natural resources faster than nature can replenish them. In 2050 it's estimated that there will be 9.7 billion of us. What will happen? We can't just go on burying it under the carpet. Population issues are politically sensitive so I talk about voluntary population optimization. So that's OK, it's voluntary, it is your choice. You optimize it for your financial situation. People are desperate to educate their children and they can't educate eight anymore. So they love family planning, and women can space out their children so that they can have a child and look after it. Let's switch gears. I don't eat animals. I have a dog. I love my dog. Let's talk about the idea that animals have feelings and that pigs are as intelligent as dogs...You know, animals are so much more intelligent than people used to think, and they have feelings and emotions and personalities, like your dog, any animal you share your life with. You know, birds now are making tools and octopus are incredibly intelligent. And when we think of all this trafficking of animals, selling them in meat markets or factory farms, when you think that each one one is an individual, can feel fear and pain, can suffer mentally as well as physically, isn't it shocking? I'm glad you don't eat them. I don't either, of course. Jane Goodall, the world's foremost authority on chimpanzees, communicates with a chimp named Nana at the zoo in Magdeburg, Germany, on June 6, 2004.                        JENS SCHLUETER/DDP/AFP via Getty Images                      The shock and horror because in China and South Korea they eat dogs — well, the thought of eating a dog makes me feel particularly sick, but not more sick than eating a pig. They eat dogs and we don't like it, but we eat pigs, and they are as intelligent as dogs. Isn't the point, if you must eat an animal shouldn't you treat it really well, like the Native Americans, respect the animal and give thanks that it's sacrificed itself for you?This is a bit more of a thought-provoking question: What has led us to this over-consumption in society? There is an idea that perhaps there is a Biblical basis, that we have dominion, that we're in charge, and because we're in charge we're able to do what we want. Can you give me an idea of why we are where we are, as a world right now, and what led us here? [Laughing] You think I'm going to be able to answer all these questions?I know it's a lot, but I know that you must have some thoughts on this. Well, first of all, I do think that religion has played a role. I was told by a Hebrew scholar the original translation of that word that you just mentioned, ""dominion,"" is wrong. It's actually something more like ""stewardship."" That's very different. If God gave us stewardship that's different from saying we have dominion. So I think religion started this thinking that we're so different from all the other animals and I was taught there was a difference in kind, not degree. Thank goodness the chimpanzees are so like us biologically, as well as behaviorally, that science had to start thinking differently. So how did we get there? It's sort of been like this all throughout human history. There were so many fewer of us back then that we could have these unsustainable lifestyles and it didn't really matter; they were sustainable. Think of how people have always exploited the natural world just because we can. And so there's been a lag between developing new technologies [which enable us to] destroy whole forests. Whereas the indigenous people might take a week to cut down the big tree, we can do it in an hour. And the moral evolution and the sense of a spiritual awareness and connection to the natural world on which we depend, that's lagged behind as well.So how do we repair that? How do we rediscover our connection to the rest of the natural world?As I think you know, I began a program for young people back in 1991 called Roots and Shoots because young people had lost hope in the future. I've met them all over the world. They were mostly apathetic and didn't seem to care. Or they were angry or deeply depressed and they told me they felt like that because we compromised their future and there was nothing they could do about it. And we have compromised their future. We've been stealing it for years and years. And yes, we still are still stealing it today. But when they said there was nothing they could do I thought, no, that's not right. We got this window of time. If we all get together, take action, we can start healing some of the harm, we can start slowing down climate change and we can work on educating people. Kids are really good at educating their parents and grandparents, some of whom may be in positions to make a huge difference, like CEOs of big companies or people in government. That program is now kindergarten to university and everything in between. It's in 68 countries and growing. Every group has the message: Each one of us — and that means you as well as me — we make some impact every single day and we have the luxury of choosing the impact that we make. Stunning photos of climate change63 photos"

The originally advertised final launch opportunity was August 5, but it was earlier extended to August 11 and now has been stretched to August 15 and possibly a bit beyond.In any case, NASA should have more than two weeks to get the flight off the ground before Earth and Mars move too far away from each other. Despite complications posed by coronavirus restrictions, engineers are confident they will be able to send the rover on its way.An artist's impression of the Perseverance Mars rover on the surface of the red planet.                        NASA                      But the stakes are high. If Perseverance misses the window because of technical issues, bad weather or some combination of factors, the flight will be delayed two years while Earth and Mars return to favorable positions in their orbits around the sun.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox""When you talk about Earth and Mars being on the same side of the sun, that happens once over 26 months,"" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said during a June 17 mission preview teleconference with reporters. ""So it's very expensive, if we have to take Perseverance and put it back into storage for a period of two years, it could cost half a billion dollars.""Originally targeted for launch July 17, the flight was pushed to July 20 because of trouble with ground equipment and then again to July 22 when engineers ran into problems encapsulating the spacecraft in its protective nose fairing.In a NASA blog post, the latest delay was blamed on ""a liquid oxygen sensor line"" that showed ""off-nominal data"" during a dress-rehearsal countdown June 22 when the Atlas 5 rocket, without its payload, was loaded with propellant. As a result, NASA said, ""additional time is needed for the team to inspect and evaluate.""

Jackson              The Perseverance rover's launch is designed to get the spacecraft to Mars on February 18, 2021. After a fiery plunge into the martian atmosphere, the spacecraft will rely on a huge parachute to continue slowing down before a rocket-powered descent to the floor of Jezero Crater, where an ancient river delta once deposited sediments.Loaded with state-of-the-art instruments, cameras and even a small experimental helicopter, the six-wheeled rover will search for signs of past microbial life, collecting soil and rock samples that will be sealed in small tubes and dropped onto the surface in groups.If all goes well, another rover will collect the samples and launch them into orbit around Mars, where they will be robotically recovered by a spacecraft provided by the European Space Agency. The samples then will be brought back to Earth around the end of the decade for detailed laboratory analysis."

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/my-stimulus-check-pay-income-taxes/,Stimulus check: Do you have to pay tax on the money?,['Aimee Picchi'],"['July 2, 2020']","The majority of people who qualify for a stimulus check have already received their direct deposits, paper checks or prepaid debit cards. But the payments — $1,200 for most single earners and $2,400 for most married couples — have raised plenty of questions about how they'll impact taxes. Chief among those is whether the payments, which are designed to help families weather the economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic, are subject to income taxes. In other words, should people set aside a chunk of the payment to pay the IRS when they file their 2020 tax returns? ""Something a lot of people don't realize is that stimulus payments are not taxable,"" Christina Taylor, head of tax operations at Credit Karma Tax, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""They're actually an advance on a new credit on your 2020 federal income taxes.""Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxIt's understandable that there's confusion among consumers. The IRS and Treasury's official term for the payments — economic impact payments — doesn't hint at the fact the payments are actually a type of tax credit, for example. Because the checks are advances on a tax credit for 2020, taxpayers will get another chance to reconcile their income and dependents information when they file their 2020 tax returns in early 2021. ""If you didn't qualify for the stimulus payment based on the prior year's income, but you do qualify for it based on your 2020 income, you can claim the stimulus payment as a credit on your 2020 tax return,"" Taylor noted.Meanwhile, many consumers are focused on whether a second stimulus check is in the works, with the unemployment rate remaining in the double digits and the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of July. Coronavirus: The Race To Respond                Stars remember Broadway actor Nick Cordero: ""What a light""                              Miami shuts down indoor dining and gyms as virus cases rise                              Atlanta mayor tests positive for coronavirus                              ICE says foreign students can't take online-only fall classes                              Only 40% of Harvard undergrads will return to campus this fall                          More in Coronavirus: The Race To Respond            What if my income falls in 2020?The stimulus checks that were authorized by the CARES Act in March have income thresholds. Single taxpayers who earn less than $75,000 qualify for the full $1,200 payment, while married couples who earn below $150,000 received $2,400. The payments are reduced for earnings above those thresholds, cutting off entirely for single taxpayers who earn more than $99,000 and for married couples with income above $198,000. When the IRS sent out checks starting in April, it based the payments on either your 2019 or 2018 tax returns, which reflect earnings before the coronavirus pandemic brought the economy to a standstill in March. That means if you are a higher earner whose income dropped in 2020 to below the income thresholds for the stimulus payments, you'll get the extra benefit when you file your taxes next year.People excluded from first stimulus checks sp...02:19That's because the IRS will reconcile the tax credit against your 2020 income, with tax experts saying it can only help you, not hurt you.Families also receive $500 for each child under 17, which means families with children born or adopted in 2020 will get a tax credit of $500 when they file their taxes next year, according to the IRS.Will I have to pay back stimulus money?Say your daughter was 16 when you filed your 2019 taxes, qualifying her for a $500 payment since she was under 17 at the time. What happens when you file your 2020 taxes and your daughter is 17, over the age that qualified her for that stimulus money — will you have to pay back the $500 to the IRS?No, says the tax agency.The same applies if your 2020 earnings places you above the threshold for a stimulus payment, while your 2019 or 2018 income was below the cutoff, the tax agency said.""There is no provision in the law requiring repayment of a payment,"" according to the IRS website. ""You won't be required to repay any payment when filing your 2020 tax return even if your qualifying child turns 17 in 2020 or your adjusted gross income increases in 2020 above the thresholds listed above.""What about my tax refund? Another question is whether stimulus payments will impact your tax refund next year. The answer is maybe — but only if it works out in your favor, according to Credit Karma Tax's Taylor.""For example, if your 2020 income was less than the income used to calculate your stimulus payment, you may receive a larger stimulus payment in the form of a credit when you file your 2020 taxes next year, which could increase your refund,"" she noted."

As a result, they determined no crime had been committed. Both the bureau and NASCAR described the rope as a noose.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany was pressed numerous times during Monday's White House press briefing to explain why Mr. Trump believes Wallace should apologize, especially since it was one of his crewmembers, not the driver himself, who found the noose in the garage stall. Wallace was also not the person who reported it.""The FBI, as I noted, concluded that this was not a hate crime, and he believes it would go a long way if Bubba came out and acknowledged that as well,"" McEnany said. But immediately after the FBI revealed its findings, Wallace issued a statement saying he was ""relieved"" that the probe ""revealed that this wasn't what we feared it was"" and thanked NASCAR and the FBI for taking the episode seriously.NASCAR president Steve Phelps, too, rejected the notion the discovery was part of a ""hoax,"" saying Wallace and his team ""had nothing to do with this.""Still, McEnany declined to elaborate on Mr. Trump's position and instead said the president was pointing out the ""rush to judgment"" from the press that a hate crime had been committed. She also said the president was ""not making a judgment one way or the other"" on NASCAR's ban on displays of the Confederate flag.""The whole point of the tweet was to note the incident, the alleged hate crime that in fact was not a hate crime,"" she said.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-security-agency-warns-that-vpns-could-be-susceptible-to-cyberattacks/,National Security Agency warns that VPNs could be vulnerable to cyberattacks,['Olivia Gazis'],"['July 2, 2020']","The National Security Agency issued a new cybersecurity advisory on Thursday, warning that virtual private networks, or VPNs, could be vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured. The agency's warning comes amid a surge in telework as organizations adapt to coronavirus-related office closures and other constraints.A VPN allows users to establish private, encrypted connections to another network over the internet. They are used widely by corporations and other organizations to protect proprietary data from hackers while employees work remotely. A senior NSA official who briefed reporters Wednesday said the increase in remote work had attracted the attention of potentially malicious cyber actors.  Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox""We certainly see adversaries focused on telework infrastructure,"" the official said. ""We've seen exploitation and as a result, have felt that this was a product that is particularly helpful now.""VPN gateways in particular are ""prone to network scanning, brute force attacks, and zero-day vulnerabilities,"" the NSA's advisory said. ""[N]etwork administrators should implement strict traffic filtering rules to limit the ports, protocols, and IP addresses of network traffic to VPN devices."" The senior official said the NSA, whose employees deal daily with highly classified materials and systems, had taken its own steps to adapt to the pandemic, reducing some of its workforce to ""mission-essential"" for several weeks and introducing social distancing measures within its outposts.                                Trending News                                    Consumers avoiding stores amid COVID surge                              Companies may shun Facebook now, but maybe not for long                              Twitter says fake ""Antifa"" account was run by white supremacists                              Uber acquires food delivery app Postmates                              More advertisers flee Facebook as boycott grows              The advisory was issued by the agency's Cybersecurity Directorate, which launched last October. Its mandate involves reinvigorating a set of missions the NSA has long had — protecting government and private sector systems — by accelerating, broadening and ""operationalizing"" its dissemination of unclassified threat information, according to officials.The directorate has now issued over a dozen public advisories since its launch. In October, it warned that nation-state actors were targeting VPN devices. In January, it was behind the disclosure of a ""critical vulnerability"" in Microsoft's Windows 10 software — something the agency might have once exploited, instead, as a hacking tool. And in May, in another rare move, it named a Russian military hacking unit that was secretly accessing commonly used email software.  ""Attribution is always interesting,"" the senior NSA official said Wednesday. ""We do it if we believe it creates a sense of urgency to address a vulnerability."" The directorate's emphasis on information-sharing stems from a recognition that nation states are getting more aggressive and more sophisticated in going after government and non-government targets. Its leadership has said it is also a conscious effort to move away from stubborn perceptions that the agency is a secretive black box — or ""No-Such-Agency,"" as the NSA has been labeled. (Its foreign intelligence mission — which involves intercepting signals and communications overseas — is likely to continue avoiding the public eye.)The agency has also broadened its presence on social media, launching an Instagram account, a dedicated Twitter account for the directorate, and even bringing its notoriously circumspect director to the platform. (Paul Nakasone has tweeted three times in three weeks.)""General Nakasone has looked at the environment and said, 'We see adversaries increasingly using cyber to achieve national security objectives below the level of armed conflict,'"" the senior official said. ""'We're seeing rapid technological change, which just brings in a whole new set of vulnerabilities.'""""It led him to say, 'We really need to up our game.'"""

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ppp-treasury-names-small-businesses-receiving-loans/,"Treasury names 650,000 companies that got U.S. small business loans",[],"['July 6, 2020']","The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday released the names of more than 650,000 companies that received funds from the government's small business lending program, a massive effort intended to support the economy as states shut down in April to contain the viral outbreak.The Treasury Department identified just a fraction of the total borrowers, naming only those companies that got more than $150,000 in low-interest, forgivable loans through banks working with the U.S. Small Business Administration. Those companies made up less than 15% of the nearly 5 million small businesses that received loans. The records released Monday show they include companies tied to the governors of Ohio, New Hampshire and West Virginia, among others, as well as hundreds of private equity firms, securities firms that do business on the New York Stock Exchange, and even payday lenders that charge consumers some of the highest interest rates allowed.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxThe average loan amount for the entire program was $107,000, the Treasury Department said in a broad summary of the program. The government handed out $521 billion through the Paycheck Protection Program, a crucial piece of the government's $2 trillion rescue package. The loans, which charge just 1% interest, can be forgiven if the businesses mostly use the money to continue paying their workers.Strip club owner got $5.4 million Paycheck Protection Program loan40% of Black business owners may not survive the coronavirus crisisPaycheck program didn't save enough jobs, economists sayThe recipients employed 51 million people before the pandemic began, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, or about 85% of all workers at companies with fewer than 500 employees. Not all of those jobs were saved. The government won't know how many were until companies apply to have the loans forgiven, a process that is just beginning.While the data included demographic information on some the borrowers, the officials said it was incomplete because companies were not required to supply information on their owners' race, ethnicity and gender. More of that data may become available when borrowers apply to have the loans forgiven.

Here's how much you could get              But the government was able to determine that 27% of the loan money went to businesses operating in low- and moderate-income areas, the officials said.Emergency small business relief fund runs dry...06:35The PPP was up and running just days after being approved by Congress in late March. It provided loans of up to $10 million for small businesses to help them recover from the government-ordered shutdowns and revenue losses caused by the virus outbreak. The ability to convert the loans to grants made the program seem particularly appealing.Once opened April 3, the PPP sparked a flood of applications from desperate small business owners. The SBA approved more than 1.6 million loans worth $349 million in less than two weeks, exhausting the initial funding. Millions of other businesses had to wait nearly two more weeks for Congress to approve an additional $310 million. Nearly 3.2 million loans worth $172 billion were approved in the second round as of June 30, leaving around $132 billion unclaimed. Congress approved an extension of the program this week until Aug. 8.Economists generally credit the program with helping prevent the job market meltdown from being much worse. Employers added 7.5 million jobs in May and June, a solid increase although it still left the economy with nearly 15 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic. Many economists credit the PPP with driving some of that gain.Yet other analyses, such as one conducted by economists at Standard & Poor's, found that businesses in states with fewer job losses received more loans than those in harder-hit states.Private equity-owned companies got helpNearly 600 portfolio management companies and private equity firms took money from the PPP program, an Associated Press review of the data show.Private equity firms and portfolio managers were not an industry heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Their employees were largely able to keep working, and they were not industries that had to be shut down by state or local government orders. Investment managers and private equity firms also tend to be extremely well paid positions.According to the data, those 583 companies reported saving roughly 14,800 jobs collectively with the funds from the program. That'a an average of 25 employees per company.Rosenblatt Securites, one of the biggest names on the floor of the NYSE, took out a $1 million to $2 million loan.Political names received money Some familiar political names are showing up in data revealing who received funding for businesses during the outbreak.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice's family companies received at least $6.3 million from the federal rescue package. Justice, a Republican, is considered to be West Virginia's richest man through ownership of dozens of coal and agricultural businesses, many of which have been sued for unpaid debts. At least six Justice family businesses received the Paycheck Protection Program loans, including the Greenbrier Sporting Club, an exclusive members-only club attached to a lavish resort Justice owns called the Greenbrier. A representative for the governor's family companies did not immediately return emails seeking comment.A company owned by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine is among those that received loans. Data released Monday shows DeWine Seeds-Silver Dollar Baseball received a loan under the PPP for a range of $150,000 to $350,000. The company owns the Asheville Tourists, a minor league baseball team in North Carolina, which was purchased by the governor's family in 2010. DeWine's son, Brian DeWine, is the president of the baseball team.Waterville Valley Holdings, an investment group led by the family of New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, got a loan of between $350,000 and $1 million. The company is the principal investor in the Waterville Valley Resort, a ski area where Sununu, a Republican, served as CEO until just before he took office in 2017.Robin J. Vos Enterprises, a popcorn manufacturing company run by Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos received between $150,000 and $350,000. Vos is a Republican and his spokeswoman, Kit Beyer, didn't immediately respond to a message inquiring about why the company was seeking the money and how it's been used.An owner of 750 restaurants got loansMuy Brands Inc., a San Antonio, Texas, franchisee with more than 750 Wendy's, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants, received between $15 million and $30 million through the Paycheck Protection Program.CEO James Bodenstedt is also a major donor to President Trump. He has given $300,000 to the Trump Victory PAC since the start of this year, according to federal campaign finance records. A message seeking comment was left with Muy Brands.Payday lenders among the government borrowersRoughly 120 payday lenders and auto title lenders took loans from the Paycheck Protection Program. Most took out smaller loans, typically less than $350,000. These types of businesses typically lend money to poor and disaffected individuals in desperate need for cash, often at high interest rates.Online lenders which often offer to consolidate loans in return for high fees also took government loans. Avant, Prosper Marketplace and Upstart were among them.Creditcorp, a high interest-rate lender and debt collector, took out a loan of between $5 million and $10 million loan."

Guillén, who had been missing since April, was killed and dismembered by a fellow soldier who took his own life last week, according to federal and military investigators.    Human remains were found Tuesday near the Leon River in Bell County, about 20 miles east of Fort Hood, during a the search for Guillén. An Army spokesman said earlier Sunday that they were still waiting for positive identification of the remains. Investigators were unable to use dental records to identify Guillén because of the state of her remains, and instead used DNA from bone and hair samples, attorney Natalie Khawam, who is representing Guillén's family, told CBS News correspondent Mireya Villerrael. Guillén's family received the information in the company of their priest, she said. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxArmy officials identified the soldier suspected in Guillén's disappearance as Aaron David Robinson. Cecily Aguilar, a 22-year-old civilian from a community near near Fort Hood, was arrested and charged with one count for allegedly helping hide the body of 20-year-old solider, according to a criminal complaint. According to a complaint, Aguilar confessed and said Robinson repeatedly hit Guillen with a hammer, killing her, at Fort Hood on April 22. She was then mutilated and burned in an attempt to dispose of the body with Aguilar's help, according to the confession. Aguilar, Robinson's girlfriend, described the series of events to investigators during an interview on June 30.   Guillén's family has said that they believe she was sexually harassed by Robinson and is calling for a congressional investigation.

Ward attended college 10 years ago but dropped out after a few semesters. ""I never lost that need or that want to do more schooling or have a degree,"" Ward told CBS News on Tuesday. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox""I got the inspiration [to go back] after talking specifically to my high schoolers about a passion of mine, which is history,"" Ward said. ""Just talking with them a little bit about history ... it inspired me, especially hearing them say, 'You should be my teacher.'""So, in May of last year, he enrolled at MassBay Community College while still driving a bus in Framingham full-time. His ultimate goal was to become a high school history teacher. Ward said eventually, the students that he talked to on the bus learned that he had gone back to school. ""It came up in conversation, especially some of the older ones who are starting to look at colleges ... I said, 'If you're looking at community college, you should look at MassBay, it's a good school,'"" he said.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-return-2020-what-happens-do-not-file/,What happens if you don't file a tax return?,['Irina Ivanova'],"['July 6, 2020']","If taxes are the last thing on your mind right now, you're in good company. With a national pandemic and the worst economic contraction in recorded U.S. history, taxes might not be the fist thing on your mind. If you need more time than the already-extended July 15 deadline provides, filing for an extension until October 15 is straightforward and takes just a few minutes.But what if you haven't filled out your tax return in years? What if you never file taxes?In the best-case scenario, non-filers could be missing out on money owed  to you, experts say. In the worst case, you could be on the hook for  penalties and interest, and enter into a protracted battle with the IRS.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxSometimes people skip filing a tax return once and get stuck not filing year after year because they're afraid of the penalty, according to Nina Olson, the founder of the Taxpayer Rights Center.""Something I see a lot is people get behind one year, and then they think, 'Well, I'm not going this file this year because I owe money,'"" Olson told CBS News in a February interview. ""Then they [don't] file the next year because they think, 'If I file the next year, they'll fine me for the last year. But I'm owed a refund this year. But I'm just gonna stay underground.' And then they keep going on, and then finally the IRS finds them. And then it's a mess."" Olson should know — she served as the National Taxpayer Advocate for 19 years before stepping down in 2019.

Here's how much you could get              In these cases, she says, ""the worst thing that you can do is nothing at all."" Reaching out to the agency to tell them you may owe taxes is always preferable than having the IRS find you. The tax agency acknowledged that people's finances may be tight because of the pandemic, and encouraged taxpayers to get in touch. ""The IRS understands that those affected by  the coronavirus may not be able to pay their balances in full by July  15, but we have many payment options to help taxpayers,"" IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in a statement. ""These easy-to-use payment options are available on IRS.gov, and most can be done automatically without reaching out to an IRS representative.""The agency offers a guide for filing taxes if it's been a while, as well as a tool to find out if you're not required to file.When the feds do your taxes If you've gone a decade without filing a tax return and nothing has happened, that doesn't mean you're off the hook. If you have any income at all, the agency can use that to essentially file a tax return on your behalf. Tax experts note that almost any non-cash income you get is reported to the IRS. That could be pay stubs from a job, a 1099 from your bank or brokerage, money from a gig or side hustle or earnings from selling on Amazon or eBay. What the Tax Day extension means for you04:10If you haven't filed a return, the IRS can use all that information to automatically create a tax return for you — something known as an Automated Substitute for Return, or ASFR. Some 380,000 taxpayers got this treatment in 2019, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate. Unlike your personal accountant, the ASFR program will assume the worst for the taxpayer: It takes into account income, but ignores any deductions they may be entitled to. ""Let's say you're married with five children — that would really impact your taxable income. But the IRS doesn't know that,"" Olson said.If you receive an ASFR, as with any tax notice, tax experts suggest reaching out to the IRS as soon as possible. After a certain period, if the IRS doesn't hear from you it will start collection proceedings — including such things as freezing your bank account or garnishing your wages.The feds have no deadline There's one other reason not to delay. The IRS' timeline to go after non-filers is essentially unlimited. ""[T]here's no statute of limitations for assessing and collecting the tax if no return has been filed,"" the agency says. If you file a return, the IRS has three years to audit it and ask for additional tax. (In extreme circumstances the deadline extends to six years.) The same goes for taxpayers, who have a three-year time limit to claim any refunds they may be owed. Many people, especially those eligible for tax credits, may not know to expect money from the government. As many as 1.4 million people who didn't file taxes for 2016 will soon run out of time to claim their money, the IRS said last week. They have until July 15 to ask for it — by filing a tax return."

The trip also marks the president's first campaign rally in a political battleground and second mega-event since his hiatus from the trail due to the coronavirus pandemic.  The president's reelection campaign announced Sunday that the rally will take place at Portsmouth International Airport at 8 p.m. ET. According to a statement released by the Trump campaign, the outdoor event will feature ""ample access to hand sanitizer"" and all attendees ""will be provided a face mask that they are strongly encouraged to wear.""Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox""President Trump's record-setting accomplishments in record-setting time have improved the lives of all Americans.

Mr. Trump's campaign packed the same SNHU arena in August 2019 for an indoor campaign rally, boasting thousands of attendees and hundreds of protesters.But it was in 2011 that then-real estate mogul Donald Trump first dropped into Portsmouth International Airport in a Trump-emblazoned black helicopter to explore a GOP primary bid, after pushing false rumors that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.Mr. Trump lost New Hampshire in 2016 by fewer than 3,000 votes, a slim 0.4% margin of votes cast.The upcoming rally,  just a few short miles from the Maine border, is expected to also draw supporters from the neighboring state. In 2016, Mr. Trump won Maine's 2nd congressional district, making him the first Republican to score Maine electoral votes since George H. W. Bush in 1988.  The president's joint field operation with the Republican National Committee has resumed in-person organizing in New Hampshire, including door-knocking, on June 15. Under CDC guidelines, organizers employ hand sanitizer and temperature checks while hosting statewide in-person events.Mr. Trump began two weeks ago holding in-person rallies again, with a kick-off relaunch at the indoor BOK Center arena in Tulsa, Oklahoma. At least eight campaign advance staff tested positive for coronavirus while preparing for the president's event.The Portsmouth rally will be Mr. Trump's first campaign outdoors campaign rally in 2020. Republican candidate for New Hampshire's 1st congressional district, Matt Mowers, a 2016 Trump campaign official endorsed by the president, told CBS News he is excited to welcome the president back.

""Instead of helping our state safely recover, Trump is flying in for a political rally that will only further highlight the chaos he has caused."""

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uscis-funding-13400-immigration-workers-furlough-coronavirus/,"Standoff over emergency funding leaves 13,400 immigration workers facing furlough",['Camilo Montoya'],"['July 6, 2020']","In less than 30 days, the cash-strapped U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will start furloughing more than 13,400 employees — nearly 70% of its workforce — unless Congress authorizes emergency funding to avoid a scenario that would cripple the nation's legal immigration system.USCIS — which administers green card applications, work permits, asylum requests, naturalization ceremonies for would-be U.S. citizens and other immigration services — has been facing an unprecedented financial crisis, which it attributes to a drastic decrease in applications during the coronavirus pandemic that has deprived the fee-funded agency of its main source of revenue. Thousands of USCIS employees have already received notices of their looming furloughs, which would start on August 3. ""If that happens, the agency would be left with a skeleton crew that will make it difficult to sustain our critical mission of administering our nation's lawful immigration system,"" Joseph Edlow, deputy director for policy at USCIS and the de facto head of the agency, said in a statement to CBS News.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxUSCIS, which is a division of the Department of Homeland Security, informed Congress of its financial woes in the middle of May, requesting $1.2 billion in emergency funding and promising to repay the funds by imposing a 10% surcharge on applications. However, in the ensuing weeks, a standoff has emerged between Congress and the Trump administration, leaving a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the USCIS workforce and the millions of immigrants who file petitions with the agency in any given year.People take the oath of citizenship during a naturalization ceremony at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service's Field Office on Thursday, July 2, 2020, in New York.                        Frank Franklin II / AP                      Democratic and Republican congressional officials said the administration has yet to file a formal budget request, frustrating the lawmakers responsible for authorizing the funds. ""It's a moving target right now in terms of what specifically it is that we need to address in order to prevent these furloughs,"" Democratic Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, the chair of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, told CBS News. ""Everyone is in agreement and focusing on the fact that we're going to prevent those furloughs. But unfortunately, with OMB not taking any action at this time, it is very difficult to sit down and finalize what exactly is needed,"" Roybal-Allard added, referring to the White House Office of Management and Budget.Immigration                ICE says foreign students can't take online-only fall classes                              Standoff over funding leaves 13,400 immigration workers facing furlough                              Judge blocks Trump's asylum restriction for border-crossers                              Lawmakers urge ICE to release families together following court order                              Judge orders release of migrant children, citing coronavirus                          More in Immigration            The Trump administration, however, says Congress has all it needs to bailout USCIS. ""The Administration has formally requested the resources necessary to keep USCIS running,"" an OMB spokesperson told CBS News. ""Our hope is that Congressional Democrats accept our proposal to keep the lights on in a responsible manner.""On June 19, Acting OMB Director Russell Vought sent letters to congressional appropriators expressing support for a ""pay-it-forward deficit neutral approach"" to grant USCIS emergency funds. The letters, however, did not specify an amount.""The Trump White House is responsible for requesting supplemental funding, but all they have sent Congress is a one-page letter that provides virtually no information on the shortfall or proposed remedies,"" said Evan Hollander, a spokesperson for the House appropriations panel. ""Despite this egregious lack of communication, House Democrats are closely tracking USCIS' financial difficulties and are prepared to discuss solutions as part of negotiations on the next phase of coronavirus response legislation. So far, Senate Republicans are unwilling to begin those talks.""A Republican Senate aide said House appropriators have not reached out about the USCIS emergency funds. The aide also said the White House has not made a formal request for the funds, noting that Vought's June 19 letter did not include a dollar figure.Roybal-Allard said she and other lawmakers are also asking USCIS to identify the factors — in addition to fewer applications during the pandemic — that precipitated the agency's budget shortfall. Congress has yet to receive a response, she said. ""COVID is definitely a factor, but I don't believe that it is the whole reason that we are in this situation. And that's exactly what we're trying to find out, so that it can be corrected and we don't end up in the same place next year,"" she said.""A recipe for disaster""In May, USCIS attributed the agency's potential bankruptcy to a ""dramatic"" drop in applications during the pandemic, predicting that it would see a 61% decline in petition receipts through the end of September. An agency spokesperson said receipts ""have slightly improved"" since, but noted that the $1.2 billion request to Congress remained ""unchanged.""There is consensus among lawmakers, congressional staff, immigration experts and USCIS employees that the pandemic has had a large impact on the agency's operations and fee-funded model. USCIS had to postpone in-person interviews, fingerprint and photo appointments, naturalization ceremonies and other services because of the coronavirus. Though some have reopened in a limited capacity, virtually all offices were closed to the public in the spring. The agency has recently conducted smaller naturalization ceremonies, but hundreds of thousands of immigrants seeking to finalize their path to U.S. citizenship are still waiting to complete their postponed appointments. However, there's disagreement over whether the coronavirus is the sole catalyst of USCIS' dire financial predicament. Lawmakers, experts, former USCIS officials and current employees believe the agency's fiscal crisis had been brewing well before the coronavirus became widespread in the U.S., fueled by the Trump administration's restrictive immigration policies and funding priorities.USCIS publicly forecast a $1.26 billion deficit in November 2019, when it proposed fee hikes for a wide-range of its services. A recent analysis by the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute shows that revenue from petition fees has declined in the past three consecutive fiscal years — a trend that ran parallel to dwindling petitions for programs the administration has limited or sought to dismantle entirely. In fiscal year 2019, USCIS brought in $13 million less in fee revenue than in 2018, which had already seen a $152 million drop in petition funds from the previous year.Between fiscal years 2017 and 2019, USCIS has seen a significant drop in petitions for family-based green cards, naturalization, including from U.S. service members, and programs that protect certain immigrants from deportation, like Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, and the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The Trump administration has sought to end the TPS and DACA programs, but its efforts have been stymied by the courts. It has also taken unilateral action to restrict family-based immigration, including by imposing a broad wealth test for green cards that is expected to disproportionately affect low-income applicants. Citing the economic impact of the pandemic, President Trump has recently issued two sets of restrictions to limit immigrant and work visas.""Over the last four years, the policies of this administration and the way that they ran things pushed the agency to the very edge of a cliff — and COVID was the finger on the back that sent it over,"" a USCIS employee who requested anonymity to speak freely told CBS News. Another USCIS employee, who also requested anonymity and had received a furlough notice, agreed, noting the agency recently expanded its fraud detection and national security units. ""To double the size of a directorate that doesn't actually perform the core function of our agency — which is to adjudicate requests for immigration benefits — is a recipe for financial disaster,"" the employee told CBS News.USCIS pushed back on this criticism. ""There is nothing in the budget or the analysis to suggest that there is any drop in our receipts that is outside historical norms based on any policy that has been implemented during this administration,"" a spokesman said. ""In fact, the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 was better by $100M than fiscal year 2019 and far better ($200M) than it was in 2016, which should illustrate just how far receipts fell in late March forward due to COVID-19.""León Rodríguez, who led USCIS during President Barack Obama's second term, said the current situation could highlight the value of having some of the agency's offices, like those for processing asylum and refugee requests, transition from a fee-funded model, to one appropriated by Congress. ""Because both asylum and refugee work are so bound up with U.S. foreign policy — and the humanitarian and national security strategic objectives of U.S. foreign policy — it makes sense for that to be a shared investment of all the American people,"" Rodríguez told CBS News.Michael Knowles, an asylum officer and president of the union for USCIS employees in the Washington, D.C. area, said he doesn't think the American public has fully grasped the consequences of his agency's potential partial shutdown. ""Millions of people will be affected, not just people who have yet to come to the U.S., but millions who are here. Millions of workers who depend on their work permits. Millions of lawful, tax paying residents who deserve to become citizens.""Knowles said he's still hopeful Congress and the administration may reach a compromise before August 3, noting that the two branches have frequently acted ""at the last minute"" during crises.Sara Cook contributed to this report."

Another section of the order forbids lobbying the administration by former political appointees for the remainder of Trump's time in office.Yet five lobbyists who are former administration officials have potentially done just that during the coronavirus lobbying boom:— Courtney Lawrence was a former deputy assistant secretary for legislation in the Department of Health and Human Services in 2017 and 2018. She became a lobbyist for Cigna in 2018 and is listed as part of a team that has lobbied HHS, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and at least two other agencies. Cigna did not respond to a request for comment.— Shannon McGahn, the wife of former White House counsel Don McGahn, worked in 2017 and 2018 as a counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. She then joined the National Association of Realtors as its top lobbyist and is listed on disclosures as part of a team that has lobbied both houses of Congress, plus six agencies, including the Treasury Department. The Realtors association did not respond to a request for comment.— Jordan Stoick is the vice president of government relations at the National Association of Manufacturers. Stoick's biography on NAM's website indicates that he is ""NAM's lead lobbyist in Washington,"" where he started working after serving as a senior adviser in the Treasury Department. Disclosures indicate that Stoick and his colleagues lobbied both houses of Congress plus at least five executive branch agencies, including Treasury.""NAM carefully adheres to the legal and ethical rules regulating lobbying activity, including ensuring that its employees comply with all applicable prohibitions on contacting their former employers,"" Linda Kelly, the organization's general counsel, said in a statement.— Geoffrey Burr joined the firm Brownstein Hyatt after serving as chief of staff to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. The firm's lobbying disclosure for the first quarter of 2020 includes Burr on a list of lobbyists who contacted the White House and Congress on coronavirus-related matters on behalf of McDonald's.— Emily Felder joined Brownstein Hyatt after leaving the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, where she worked in the legislative office. Felder is listed on a disclosure from the first quarter of 2020 that shows she was part of a team that lobbied Congress and the White House.A spokeswoman for the firm said both Felder and Burr abide by the Trump administration's ethics rules, which limit their lobbying to the House and the Senate.""We are confident that our lobbyists are in compliance with all lobbying rules and applicable prohibitions and did not violate their Trump Administration pledge,"" spokeswoman Lara Day said in a statement.Public Citizen's Craig Holman, who himself is a registered lobbyist, said the group intends to file ethics complaints with the White House. But he's not optimistic that they will lead to anything. Last year, he filed more than 30 complaints, all of which were either ignored or rejected.""There does not appear to be anyone who is enforcing the executive order,"" Holman said."

The trip also marks the president's first campaign rally in a political battleground state and second mega-event since his hiatus from the trail due to the coronavirus pandemic. The president's reelection campaign announced Sunday that the rally will take place at Portsmouth International Airport at 8 p.m. ET. According to a statement released by the Trump campaign, the outdoor event will feature ""ample access to hand sanitizer"" and all attendees ""will be provided a face mask that they are strongly encouraged to wear."" Trump campaign officials tell CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga that all attendees will also be required to pass a temperature check upon entry. Though the event will technically take place on federal land at the former site of Pease Air Force Base, the Trump campaign has coordinated with Governor Chris Sununu's office and state officials ahead of Saturday's event.There have been over 5,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases in New Hampshire, and more than 380 deaths, according to the state's Department of Public Health. Nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire residents disapprove of Mr. Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a University of New Hampshire survey released last month. In a survey of New Hampshire voters released last month, Mr. Trump trails Joe Biden. The presumptive Democratic nominee led the GOP incumbent 49% to 42% among registered voters, according to the Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll. Mr. Trump last visited the Granite State on February 10, which was the eve of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, for a crowded indoor rally in downtown Manchester. But it was in 2011 that then-real estate mogul Donald Trump first dropped into Portsmouth International Airport in a Trump-emblazoned black helicopter to explore a GOP primary bid, after pushing false rumors that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.The upcoming rally, just a few short miles from the Maine border, is expected to also draw supporters from the neighboring state. In 2016, Mr. Trump won Maine's 2nd congressional district, making him the first Republican to score Maine electoral votes since George H. W. Bush in 1988. The Republican mayor of the Democratic-leaning city of Portsmouth, Rick Becksted, said he learned of the rally Sunday evening while watching the news and receiving email inquiries.      Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxFROM THE CANDIDATESJOE BIDENJoe Biden continues to chart a rhetorical contrast on Mr. Trump's declared ""war"" on cancel culture and the debate over racial equality in the country, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports.

In his Independence Day message, Biden cited notes of history on slavery and the Civil War as examples of work still needed to fulfill the country's founding promise ""that all men [and women] are created equal."" The former vice president didn't appear anywhere publicly for the Fourth of July as his focus has been hyper cognizant on social distancing guidelines from both federal officials and officials in his home state of Delaware.

In a letter to companies including Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz sent last week and released Monday, Warren along with Senators Jeff Merkley and Cory Booker wrote that failing to take substantial virus protection measures could have impacts beyond the health of their workers. ""Outbreaks in your facilities could threaten the broader food supply chain by further exacerbating existing labor shortages and reducing plant processing capacity,"" they wrote. ""Given the increasing consolidation of your industry, both producers and consumers could be left with limited alternatives, negatively affecting market opportunities for farmers and creating potential shortages for consumers.""

Bottoms later said in an interview on MSNBC that the news came as a shock to her, as she had only experienced mild allergy-like symptoms. ""This is startling for me because we've been so very careful. But certainly we are not immune."" Bottoms said in the interview and added, ""This is just a lesson to everyone.

The decision from the Supreme Court comes just months ahead of the November general election, when voters will head to the polls to elect a president and vice president. ""The Constitution's text and the nation's history both support allowing a state to enforce an elector's pledge to support his party's nominee — and the state voters' choice — for president,"" Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court. Justice Sonia Sotomayor took no part in the decision of the dispute involving faithless electors in Colorado.

Kennedy, an educator and wife of former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy, has the endorsements of Governor Phil Murphy and the Atlantic County Democratic Party, where one-third of voters reside. Harrison originally filed to primary Van Drew the week he voted against impeachment, and has been backed by six county chairs as well as Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker.  Another candidate in the running is Will Cunningham, a former congressional staffer who ran against Van Drew in the 2018 primary. New Jersey's 3rdDemocrat freshman Andy Kim is among the top targets for national Republicans, as Mr. Trump won this district by 6 points in 2016 before Kim narrowly flipped it in the midterms. In his district is a competitive GOP primary between engineer & lawyer David Richter and Kate Gibbs, a former elected official in Burlington County. Richter has loaned his campaign more money, but Gibbs has gotten support from outside groups such as the Defending Main Street PAC. New Jersey's 5thCongressman Josh Gottheimer is facing a challenge from the left with local Councilwoman Arati Kreibich. Kreibich has recently been backed by progressive stalwarts like Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders. Gottheimer, who is in his second term, has the backing of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Representatives Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey.  Gottheimer is currently co-chair of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, and Kreibich's campaign has looked to tie Gottheimer's focus on bipartisanship to the Republican party and Wall Street. Internal Gottheimer polls have him with a safe lead (62% to 21%), while Kreibich's internal polling shows her within a two-point margin after respondents were given more information about her platform and messaging.

Only four people of the 145 known infected individuals in the U.S. have survived, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Naegleria fowleri   is contacted when contaminated water enters through a person's nose, and is found in warm freshwater such as lakers, rivers and hot springs, according to the CDC. Its peak season in Florida is in July, August and September, the Department of Health said, and it grows best at temperatures of 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxIt is also possible to contract Naegleria fowleri in swimming pools that are not properly chlorinated, or contaminated neti pots. A person can't contract Naegleria fowleri from drinking contaminated water, since it's only contracted through the nose.Symptoms of a Naegleria fowleri include severe frontal headache, fever, nausea and vomiting. Later symptoms can also include stiff neck, seizures, altered mental status, hallucinations and coma.Signs of infection typically start a few days after swimming or other nasal exposure to contaminated water.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cell-phone-data-show-consumers-avoiding-stores-as-covid-19-cases-surge/,"Phone data show consumers avoiding stores, restaurants as COVID surges",['Megan Cerullo'],"['July 2, 2020']","Cell phone data that track users' whereabouts show that fewer Americans are patronizing local businesses and chain stores as COVID-19 cases surge in states like Arizona, California and Florida — a worrying sign that may dash hopes for a swift economic rebound after consumer spending dropped sharply at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The phone data show millions of American consumers basically voting with their feet. Traffic at retail and food establishments ticked upward for most of April and May as businesses reopened, emboldening people to venture outside, but it has started to drop again since mid-June, marking one of the first periods of deceleration since city and state lockdowns began. That's according to SafeGraph, which married anonymized cell phone data with its database of business listings and points of interest.Foot traffic reached its lowest point on April 14, when it was down 55% from January levels. Since that nadir, the nation has started easing up and there's been a gradual recovery. ""Now, that's starting to flatline and turn reverse course in the past few days,"" SafeGraph spokesperson Nick Singh said of the latest consumer patterns. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxData from restaurant reservation service OpenTable show a similar trend, with the level of sit-down dining patrons picking up in early June but dropping again at the end of the month.Experts say the data illustrate some of the economic consequences of reopening too quickly and how early efforts to jumpstart the economy appear to be backfiring. Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has for months warned the business community of these risks. Coronavirus: The Race To Respond                Stars remember Broadway actor Nick Cordero: ""What a light""                              Miami shuts down indoor dining and gyms as virus cases rise                              Atlanta mayor tests positive for coronavirus                              ICE says foreign students can't take online-only fall classes                              Only 40% of Harvard undergrads will return to campus this fall                          More in Coronavirus: The Race To Respond            ""If we end up coming out too soon and that results in substantial spread of the virus, that will be counterproductive in re-opening of economy. The more we box the virus in, the more space there is for us in society,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch in May.""A grand opening surge""It's not all linked to an uptick in COVID cases, though. Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said customers' brief returns to stores would have been short-lived no matter what. ""People were cooped up for a month, so as soon as they heard bars opening, they jumped back out,"" he said. ""It was a grand opening surge, and those things don't have legs."" SafeGraph measured the number of visits to millions of retail chains and mom-and-pop businesses from March through June and compared them to the number of visits during a baseline week in mid-January before the pandemic had taken hold in the U.S.On June 28, restaurants, stores and other establishments saw a 20% decrease in visitors compared to January. A week earlier, on June 21, they had been only 18% less busy. This recent dip in traffic is even more acute in states suffering from the sharpest increases in coronavirus cases as a result of governments relaxing social distancing measures and allowing businesses to reopen more fully — by permitting, for example, restaurants to seat customers inside.  Retail stores face uphill battle during pande...01:57Case numbers in Florida rose most sharply between June 22 and June 27, when they hit 9,019 new cases in one day, compared to 3,200 new cases on June 22, according to Johns Hopkins University's coronavirus case tracker. Bars in Florida saw a 5% percent drop in foot traffic over the same period, according to the SafeGraph data. Sit-down restaurants in the Sunshine State saw similar declines in patron counts. These data show what pubic health experts and economists alike have tried to impress upon the public — that containing the virus and reviving the economy go hand-in-hand. A separate set of credit card transaction data also show that residents in states with newly rising coronavirus case counts are making fewer visits to restaurants, stores and other places where people typically spend money.A report from Facteus, which collects anonymized data from financial companies and card issuers, shows that year-over-year growth in overall spending started decelerating on June 25 in the U.S.. Retail spending growth dropped 14 percentage points between June 21 and June 28, marking the biggest negative change in week-to-week growth during the recovery so far. ""The retail space has been trending very high over the past couple of months driven by e-commerce, but we have seen a deceleration in that. It's gone back down to prior levels to where it was in the April and early-May time frame,"" said Steve Shaw, a spokesperson for Facteus. Average retail spending growth was up 28% in mid-May, as a result, in part, of Americans receiving stimulus checks directed by the CARES Act. ""Obviously, they were not spending it on entertainment and travel, so they were using it in the retail space,"" Shaw added.The deceleration is likely due to a combination of factors, including consumers' stimulus checks running out as well as additional unemployment aid ending. It also appears to be tied to the virus' resurgence in states like Arizona, Florida and Texas, where infection rates are spiking again after they abandoned social distancing precautions. Growth rates in all three states are trending lower than the broader economy, according to Facteus' analysis, perhaps because many residents have become fearful of going out. Texas lags by about 4% compared to the rest of the U.S., while Florida lags by 5% and Arizona by 7%. ""It's only one week, but it's certainly something that we are going to be focusing on and paying attention to,"" Shaw said.Cohen of Columbia Business School predicts a ""pretty wild ride downward"" for the foreseeable future. ""If you ask me when I think this is going to be 'over,' I think it's way out in 2022 when the health issue has been solved or is under control and the extraordinary economic damage this virus has created has begun to ameliorate,"" he said. "

Daniels changed it to ""I get up in the morning.

It was voted single of the year by the Country Music Association.In the climactic verse, Daniels sang:""The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.""He laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet.""Johnny said, `Devil just come on back if you ever want to try again.""I told you once you son of a gun, I'm the best that's ever been.""He hosted regular Volunteer Jam concerts in Nashville in which the performers usually were not announced in advance.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/companies-boycotting-facebook-ads-why-different-than-other-boycott/,More advertisers fleeing Facebook as boycott grows,['Irina Ivanova'],"['June 30, 2020']","A growing number of major advertisers are abandoning Facebook amid criticism the social media company is letting hateful or false posts go unchecked.Chipotle, HP, Pfizer and Puma are the latest to pull their ads from Facebook. They join a list of major brands including Adidas, Clorox, Coca-Cola, Conagra, Denny's, Ford, Starbucks, Unilever and scores of smaller businesses that have halted advertising on the platform. A pledge by Mark Zuckerberg on Friday to label rule-breaking posts has done little to mollify advertisers. In all, more than 100 brands have pledged to boycott the social media giant, while prominent critics including Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have also thrown their influential weight behind the boycott, according to reports. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxThe campaign also appears to have dented Facebook's stock. Its shares have dropped roughly 8% since the boycott started gaining steam last week, slashing $53 billion off the company's stock market value. Although Facebook has faced plenty of boycotts in the past, the latest campaign — spearheaded by leading civil rights groups such as the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League — could have more staying power, analysts say.""What's different this time is we have a bunch of significant large brands that are getting on board, and we have a number of large brands that are not getting on board with the boycott but taking action of their own beyond what the boycott asks for,"" said Nicole Perrin, principal analyst at eMarketer.                                Trending News                                    FDA warns about 5 additional toxic hand sanitizers                              Kanye West's Yeezy got millions in small business loans                              Treasury names small businesses receiving PPP loans                              Trump-connected lobbyists reap windfall in COVID-19 boom                              A second stimulus check? Here's how much you could get              Take Unilever. The consumer goods giant, which owns brands including Dove, Hellman's and Lipton, said it would stop advertising on Twitter as well as Facebook and Instagram until at least year-end. Unilever cited ""divisiveness"" on the platforms in its announcement that it would remove its advertising, but did not mention the boycott campaign led by the civil rights groups. Facebook to start labeling rule-breaking post...01:50Neither did Coca-Cola, which is pulling all social ads for a month, nor Clorox, which promised to stay off Facebook until December. Similarly, Starbucks merely announced its intention to stand against online hate-speech, saying in part: ""[Both] business leaders and policy makers need to come together to affect real change.""For Perrin, this is a sign that big brands could be getting uncomfortable with social media sites or user-generated content in general. Speaking of Unilever, she said, ""I thought this was an example of a brand expressing discomfort with being in places where people are essentially expressing in free political discussion ahead of an election. There was no way that there wasn't going to be division.""Asking for total harmony on the platform ""would be difficult to impossible for Facebook to deliver,"" she said, and would require ""fundamental changes to the way user-generated platforms operate, and how much they allow people to say."" Bottom-line impact?Big advertisers like Unilever — which spent just over $8 billion on marketing last year — as well as Clorox and Coca-Cola can help drive broader change in the media world. But when it comes to Facebook, their exodus doesn't do much to affect its bottom line. More than 8 million advertisers use the platform, according to eMarketer. The top 100 advertisers on Facebook contribute just 6% of its revenue, according to Pathmatics data cited by analysts at Raymond James, and no advertiser is irreplaceable. ""[S]ocial platforms are typically able to replace lost advertisers with other advertisers given the auction dynamics of the platforms,"" Aaron Kessler, an analyst with the investment bank, wrote in a note to investors.There are other reasons for big-name brands to avoid social media, Perrin noted. For many well-known consumer brands, the ability to target niche groups that Facebook offers may not be as important as it would be to smaller businesses. And, because of the coronavirus pandemic, advertisers were already looking to cut spending.Trump lauds Facebook, slams Twitter07:50Still, if there's a surefire way of getting Facebook's attention, vocal complaints by big advertisers rank high. Advertising still represents the vast majority of Facebook's revenue, and media reports indicate that senior executives at the company are working hard to keep ad buyers happy. The company's head of trust and safety policy recently acknowledged its ""trust deficit,"" according to the Financial Times.The campaigners have indicated that yanking U.S. ad spending is just a starting point. The CEO of Common Sense Media, one of the groups behind the Facebook ad boycott, told Axios the focus was shifting overseas, where many brands put their marketing dollars."

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51214864,Coronavirus: What it does to the body,James Gallagher,['14 March 2020'],"Image copyrightGetty Images The coronavirus emerged in only December last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - Covid-19.For most, the disease is mild, but some people die. So how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated?Incubation periodThis is when the virus is establishing itself.Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them.The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face.It first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into ""coronavirus factories"" that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells. At this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms. The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionEverything you need to know about the coronavirus – explained in one minute by the BBC's Laura FosterMild diseaseThis is all most people will experience. Covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough. Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed.The fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. It has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines.These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever.The coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus. Some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. You won't need specialist hospital care.  This stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus.However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19.This is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too.EASY STEPS: How to keep safeA SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?WHO'S AT RISK: Are women and children less affected?CONTAINMENT: What it means to self-isolateMAPS AND CHARTS: Visual guide to the outbreakVIDEO: The 20-second hand washSevere diseaseIf the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus. Those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. Too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body. ""The virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know,"" said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London.Image copyrightSPLImage caption                    Scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia                Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia. If it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs.This is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe. This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China.Critical diseaseIt is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill.By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death. The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body. It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely. Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive.  It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines.""The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania said.And if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage. Treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ECMO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in.But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive. The first deathsDoctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts.The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs. The first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital.He was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating.He died 11 days after he was admitted.The second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome.He was attached to an ECMO machine but this wasn't enough. He died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed.Follow James on Twitter."
https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51963486,Coronavirus: When will the outbreak end and life get back to normal?,James Gallagher,['23 March 2020'],"Image copyrightGetty ImagesThe world is shutting down. Places that were once teeming with the hustle and bustle of daily life have become ghost-towns with massive restrictions put on our lives - from lockdowns and school closures to travel restrictions and bans on mass gatherings.It is an unparalleled global response to a disease. But when will it end and when will we be able to get on with our lives?Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he believes the UK can ""turn the tide"" against the outbreak within the next 12 weeks and the country can ""send coronavirus packing"".But even if the number of cases starts to fall in the next three months, then we will still be far from the end.It can take a long time for the tide to go out - possibly years.It is clear the current strategy of shutting down large parts of society is not sustainable in the long-term. The social and economic damage would be catastrophic.What countries need is an ""exit strategy"" - a way of lifting the restrictions and getting back to normal.But the coronavirus is not going to disappear. If you lift the restrictions that are holding the virus back, then cases will inevitably soar. ""We do have a big problem in what the exit strategy is and how we get out of this,"" says Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh.""It's not just the UK, no country has an exit strategy.""It is a massive scientific and societal challenge.A SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?NEW GUIDANCE: What must I do?NEW RESTRICTIONS: What are they?LOOK-UP TOOL: Check cases in your areaMAPS AND CHARTS: Visual guide to the outbreakThere are essentially three ways out of this mess.vaccinationenough people develop immunity through infectionor permanently change our behaviour/society Each of these routes would reduce the ability of the virus to spread. Vaccines - at least 12-18 months awayA vaccine should give someone immunity so they do not become sick if they are exposed. Immunise enough people, about 60% of the population, and the virus cannot cause outbreaks - the concept known as herd immunity.The first person was given an experimental vaccine in the US this week after researchers were allowed to skip the usual rules of performing animal tests first.Vaccine research is taking place at unprecedented speed, but there is no guarantee it will be successful and will require immunisation on a global scale. The best guess is a vaccine could still be 12 to 18-months away if everything goes smoothly. That is a long time to wait when facing unprecedented social restrictions during peacetime. ""Waiting for a vaccine should not be honoured with the name 'strategy', that is not a strategy,"" Prof Woolhouse told the BBC.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    A cough is one of the symptoms of Covid-19                Natural immunity - at least two years awayThe UK's short-term strategy is to drive down cases as much as possible to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed - when you run out of intensive care beds then deaths spike.Once cases are suppressed, it may allow some measures to be lifted for a while - until cases rise and another round of restrictions are needed. When this might be is uncertain. The UK's chief scientific advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, said ""putting absolute timelines on things is not possible"".Doing this could, unintentionally, lead to herd immunity as more and more people were infected. But this could take years to build up, according to Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London: ""We're talking about suppressing transmission at a level whereby, hopefully, only a very small fraction of the country will be infected. ""So eventually, if we continued this for two-plus years, maybe a sufficient fraction of the country at that point might have been infected to give some degree of community protection.""But there is a question mark over whether this immunity will last. Other coronaviruses, which cause common cold symptoms, lead to a very weak immune response and people can catch the same bug multiple times in their lifetime. Alternatives - no clear endpoint""The third option is permanent changes in our behaviour that allow us to keep transmission rates low,"" Prof Woolhouse said.This could include keeping some of the measures that have been put in place. Or introducing rigorous testing and isolation of patients to try to stay on top of any outbreaks.""We did early detection and contact tracing the first time round and it didn't work,"" Prof Woolhouse adds.Developing drugs that can successfully treat a Covid-19 infection could aid the other strategies too.They could be used as soon as people show symptoms in a process called ""transmission control"" to stop them passing it onto others.Or to treat patients in hospital to make the disease less deadly and reduce pressures on intensive care. This would allow countries to cope with more cases before needing to reintroduce lockdowns.Increasing the number of intensive care beds would have a similar effect by increasing the capacity to cope with larger outbreaks. I asked the UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, what his exit strategy was. He told me: ""Long term, clearly a vaccine is one way out of this and we all hope that will happen as quickly as possible.""And that ""globally, science will come up with solutions"".Follow James on Twitter"
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52840763,Coronavirus: The mystery of asymptomatic 'silent spreaders',David Shukman,['31 May 2020'],"As the crisis has unfolded, scientists have discovered more evidence about a strange and worrying feature of the coronavirus. While many people who become infected develop a cough, fever and loss of taste and smell, others have no symptoms at all and never realise they're carrying Covid-19. Researchers say it's vital to understand how many are affected this way and whether ""silent spreaders"" are fuelling the pandemic.When people gathered at a church in Singapore on 19 January, no-one could have realised that the event would have global implications for the spread of coronavirus. It was a Sunday and, as usual, one of the services was being conducted in Mandarin. Among the congregation at The Life Church and Missions, on the ground floor of an office building, was a couple, both aged 56, who'd arrived that morning from China.As they took their seats, they seemed perfectly healthy so there was no reason to think they might be carrying the virus. At that time, a persistent cough was understood to be the most distinctive feature of Covid-19 and it was seen as the most likely way to transmit it. Having no symptoms of the disease should have meant having no chance of spreading it.  The couple left as soon as the service was over. But shortly afterwards, things took a turn for the worse, and in a wholly confusing way. The wife started to become ill on 22 January, followed by her husband two days later. Because they had flown in from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, that was no big surprise.But over the following week, three local people also came down with the disease for no obvious reason, leading to one of Singapore's first and most baffling coronavirus cases. Working out what had happened would lead to a new and disturbing insight into how the virus was so successfully finding new victims.Mobilising 'disease detectives'""We were extremely perplexed,"" says Dr Vernon Lee, head of communicable diseases at Singapore's Ministry of Health. ""People who didn't know one another somehow infected each other,"" while showing no sign of illness. This new batch of cases simply did not make sense, according to what was known about Covid-19 back then.So Dr Lee and his fellow scientists, along with police officers and specialist disease trackers, launched an investigation, generating detailed maps showing who was where and when. This involved the very best of the process known as contact tracing - a version of which is getting under way now in the UK. It's seen as a vital system for tracking down everyone involved in an outbreak and helping to stamp it out, and Singapore is renowned for the skill and speed with which this is carried out.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Early in the pandemic, Singapore was seen as a shining example of how to tackle the virus                Amazingly, within a few days, investigators had spoken to no fewer than 191 members of the church and had found out that 142 of them had been there that Sunday. They quickly established that two of the Singaporeans who became infected had been at the same service as the Chinese couple. ""They could have spoken to each other, greeted each other, during the usual activities of a church service,"" says Dr Lee.That was a useful start and would explain in theory how the infection could have been passed on, apart from one key factor. It did not answer the crucial question of how the virus could have been transmitted by the two Chinese people when at that stage they had shown no indication of having the disease.And on top of that was an even greater puzzle. It was confirmed that the third Singaporean to become infected, a 52-year-old woman, had not been at the same service as the others. Instead she had attended another event in the same church later that day, so how could she have picked up the virus?Evidence no-one expectedInvestigators resorted to going through the CCTV recordings made at the church that Sunday to search for clues. And they stumbled across something completely unexpected - the woman who'd attended the later service, after the Chinese couple had left, had sat in the seats they had used several hours earlier.Somehow, despite having no symptoms and not feeling ill, the Chinese husband and wife had managed to spread the virus. Maybe they'd had it on their hands and touched the seats, maybe their breath carried the infection and it landed on a surface, it's not clear, but the implications were huge.For Dr Lee, piecing everything together, there was only one possible explanation - that the virus was being passed by people who had it without even realising. This was a revelation that would be relevant the world over because the central message of all public health advice on coronavirus has always been to look out for symptoms in yourself and others.But if the virus was also being spread by people without symptoms, silently and invisibly, how could the disease be stopped? He remembers the moment, while working in his office, when the reality dawned on him. ""Every time you make a scientific discovery, it is like a 'eureka' moment when you realise that this is something important that you've uncovered, through the hard work of many individuals and teams.""Spread before symptoms showWhat was revealed was what's known as ""pre-symptomatic transmission"" where someone is unaware of being infected because the cough, fever and other classic symptoms have yet to begin. Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Singapore saw a rise in cases after appearing to have the virus under control                Along with many others, this study highlighted a critical period of 24-to-48 hours before the visible onset of the disease in which people can be highly infectious, perhaps even their most infectious.Being aware of that is potentially invaluable, because as soon as you realise you're ill then everyone you've been in close contact with can be warned to stay at home.That would mean that they would be isolating during the key phase of infection before their own symptoms start. But exactly how the disease can be transmitted without a cough to project droplets containing the virus is still open to debate.One option is that simply breathing or talking to someone can do the job. If the virus is reproducing in the upper respiratory tract at that time then it's possible that some of it will emerge with each exhalation. Anyone close enough, especially indoors, could easily pick it up.And another potential form of transmission is by touch - the virus gets onto someone's hands and they touch another person or a door handle - or a seat in a church. Whatever the route, the virus is clearly exploiting the fact that people are bound to be less vigilant if they're not aware that they might be infected.Some people never show symptoms This is an even more mysterious scenario, and one that scientists simply have no definitive answer to. It's one thing to know that people can be infectious before their symptoms show, quite another when they become infected but never have any sign of it.This is what's known as being ""asymptomatic"" because you are a carrier of the disease but do not suffer in any way yourself. The most famous case is that of an Irish woman who was working as a cook in New York at the beginning of the last century.Image copyrightGetty ImagesWherever Mary Mallon was employed, in house after house, people became ill with typhoid and at least three, maybe many more, died of it, but she was completely unaffected. Eventually a connection was established and it was confirmed that she was the unwitting spreader of the disease.Reporters dubbed her ""Typhoid Mary"", a label she always resented, but the authorities took no chances and kept her in confinement for 23 years until her death in 1938.Assumptions underminedStaff nurse Amelia Powell was shocked when she found out that she is asymptomatic. She was at work on her hospital ward at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in April when a doctor rang to give her the result of a swab test.She had been feeling normal and safe behind the personal protective equipment she had to wear while caring for patients with Covid-19. But suddenly all those assumptions were undermined because, to her horror, she had tested positive. ""It was a bit like hearing that someone in the family had passed, it was surreal. I thought, 'This can't be right, not me, I'm absolutely fine,'"" says 23-year-old Amelia. She had to leave her post straightaway to go into isolation at home.A SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?RISK AT WORK: How exposed is your job?HOW A VIRUS SPREADS: An explanationRECOVERY: How long does it take to get better?""I was worried because I've seen the other side, with patients deteriorating very quickly with it, so I did wonder if this would happen to me."" But, to her surprise, at no point did she feel unwell. ""I had nothing, literally - I was exercising indoors, eating normally, sleeping normally."" At the moment it's impossible to know how many cases of infection exist but remain hidden from view.The discovery that Amelia was infected was only revealed because she was part of a study of all the staff at her hospital. It produced the surprising result that as many as 3% of more than 1,000 people were positive while showing no symptoms at the time of the test.An even greater proportion of asymptomatic cases was found on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which had been sailing off the coast of Japan earlier this year. Later branded ""a petri dish for infection"", it had around 700 cases. Researchers found that three quarters of the people who had tested positive had no symptoms. And at a care home in Washington state more than half the residents were positive but had no sign of the illness.'No single reliable study'Different studies suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many cases are asymptomatic stretching from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects.The upshot, they said, was that ""there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics"". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, ""perhaps a lot of cases"".The risk of 'silent spreaders'The biggest concern of Amelia, the nurse, was that she might have unwittingly transmitted the virus either to those she works with or to the patients who depend on her help. ""I don't think I passed it on because all the colleagues I work with tested negative but it was worrying to think how long I'd been positive for,"" she says. ""But we still don't know if people who are asymptomatic are contagious or not - it's very bizarre and the information about it at the moment is minimal.""One study in China which found that the number of asymptomatic cases was actually greater than those with symptoms had a warning for the authorities. ""As 'silent spreaders',"" the scientists wrote, ""asymptomatic carriers warrant attention as part of disease prevention and control.""Image copyrightGetty ImagesThe team that studied that Diamond Princess reckoned that asymptomatic cases were likely to be less infectious than people with symptoms but even so they're estimated to have caused a significant number of cases. The 'dark matter' of asymptomatic infectionTo try to get an answer, scientists in Norwich are pushing for the population of the entire city to be tested.""Asymptomatic cases may be the 'dark matter' of the epidemic,"" according to Prof Neil Hall, head of the Earlham Institute, a life science research centre, who's leading the initiative. Dark matter is the invisible substance believed to make up most of the matter in the universe, and it's yet to be identified.Prof Hall worries that asymptomatic cases may actually be driving the pandemic, keeping it going despite public health measures. ""If you have people who don't know they're ill while using public transport and health care facilities, inevitably that's going to increase transmission,"" he says.""Any intervention that's only based on people coming to primary health care when they have symptoms will only deal with half the problem."" A team of scientists in California believes that not knowing who's carrying the virus without symptoms is the ""Achilles Heel"" of the fight against the pandemic.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    China launched a mass testing programme in Wuhan                In their view, the only way to stop the disease from spreading is to find out who's infected regardless of whether they think they are or not. That was also the recommendation of MPs on the Commons Science and Technology Committee in a letter to the Prime Minister Boris Johnson.They wrote that the risk of asymptomatic transmission has ""a profound consequence for the management of the pandemic"". And they said that anyone looking after vulnerable people - such as health workers or care workers - should be given regular testing.A similar approach is being adopted on a far larger scale in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic is thought to have begun.As many as 6.5 million people there were tested in as little as nine days in a mass screening programme designed to detect the disease - including in those showing no symptoms.Easing of lockdownAs lockdown measures are eased and more people start to use public transport, return to work or go shopping, getting to grips with the invisible risk matters more than ever. At the moment, there is no way of telling who among the growing crowds may be carrying the virus without knowing.That's why governments the world over say it's essential that everyone cooperates with efforts to trace the contacts of anyone infected and then quickly self-isolates. They also advise that the best defence remains social distancing - to keep apart wherever you can. But where that isn't possible, the recommendation is to cover your face, even with a mask that's homemade.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    More and more governments are advising wearing face masks                When the US government announced this policy, it highlighted the discoveries made in the church in Singapore back in January. The logic is that this is not about protecting yourself, it's about protecting others from you, in case you're infected but don't know it.Many health professionals worry that masks might distract people from hand washing or social distancing, or increase the risk of contamination if they're clumsily handled. But more and more governments, most recently that of the UK, have become convinced of the benefits. Not that face coverings will halt the pandemic on their own. But because there's still so little we know about asymptomatic transmission, almost anything is worth a try.You may also be interested in:When you talk to intensive care doctors across the UK, exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of Covid-19, one phrase emerges time after time: ""We've never seen anything like this before.""They knew a new disease was coming, and they were expecting resources to be stretched by an unknown respiratory infection which had first appeared in China at the end of last year.""It felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the D-Day landings,"" says Barbara Miles, clinical director of intensive care at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, ""with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing"".Read a summary, often in their own words, of what doctors have learnt about how Covid-19 attacks the human body."
https://www.bbc.com/news/53193835,Coronavirus: Why surviving the virus may be just the beginning,Chris Morris,['3 July 2020'],"The first thing Simon Farrell can remember, after being woken from a medically induced coma, is trying to tear off his oxygen mask.He had been in intensive care for 10 days, reliant on a ventilator just to breathe. ""I was trying to pull the mask off my face, and the nurse kept putting it back on,"" he recalls. When doctors woke him up, his body had fought off the worst of Covid-19 but he still needed oxygen to support his damaged lungs. And the 46-year-old father-of-two was suffering from such severe delirium he was trying to deny himself the oxygen he required.""Try to stop me,"" he remembers saying, when nurses at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital said they would have to put his hands in boxing glove-sized medical mittens unless he relaxed.""In the end they had to tape my hands up. I was trying to tear the mittens off, I managed to bite through them, and they had to put new mittens on.""It is not an unfamiliar story for anyone working in intensive care. The assault Covid-19 mounts on the most severely ill means patients are ventilated for longer, and require a deeper level of sedation, than the typical ICU patient.That has produced ""a lot of delirium, confusion and agitation"", explains Dr Kulwant Dhadwal, a consultant who runs the intensive care unit at London's Royal Free Hospital.""Usually if you have a surgical procedure, or normal pneumonia patients come to ICU, you wake them up and they're less confused and less disoriented than this.""""This particular group of patients were a lot more difficult to wean off the ventilator.""Even when that process is a success, it is only the beginning of a long process of physical and psychological recovery. And now the UK has moved past the peak of the virus, attention is turning to the huge challenge - both in the health service and in the community - of rehabilitating Covid-19 survivors.""Often rehabilitation is seen as a Cinderella service and not a priority,"" says Sally Singh, professor of pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation at the University of Leicester.""But because of Covid, and the number of people that it has affected, the need is pressing. It has become a national priority - to support people to get better.""A long roadTens of thousands of people around the UK are now setting out on that journey.Some came close to death in intensive care units, others needed less intrusive hospital treatment to help them through the worst. All of them have had their lives changed by Covid-19.But for the most seriously ill patients in intensive care, rehabilitation begins well before they are woken from a coma. Physical and psychological support has to be there from the start. Even when a patient is asleep, nurses and therapists will move their joints and their bodies to make sure they don't get too stiff.""For example, we have an in-bed bike,"" explains Kate Tantam, a specialist rehabilitation sister in intensive care at University Hospital Plymouth NHS Trust.""Even if a patient is on multiple organ support on a ventilator, and on lots of drugs to keep them alive, we will still put them on a bike.""""We bring it to the bed, and we can put their feet into it, and the machine can then do the work for you.""ICU staff will also talk constantly to patients while they are deeply sedated, telling them where they are, and what is happening to them, and reassuring them that they are safe. It's all part of the process of preparing them for the moment when they are woken up.   ""Some patients do wake up saying, 'I remember your voice,'"" says Kulwant Dhadwal. ""They wake up with some kind of memory.""Image copyrightGetty ImagesBut the process with Covid-19 has proved even more delicate and difficult than normal, partly because so many ICU patients were on mechanical ventilators for extraordinarily long periods of time.Many of them woke up profoundly weak, although some regained strength unexpectedly quickly.""Usually when somebody's been asleep for 40 days or more, it takes six weeks or longer for them to be totally free of the ventilator, to be ready to even start walking or standing,"" Kulwant Dhadwal says.""But some of these patients were making progress within a week, which we found very unusual, very specific to this disease.""Another challenge in the immediate recovery from critical illness with Covid-19 is the severe inflammation.Many patients can't cope with a breathing tube inserted through the mouth because the larynx and the area above the vocal cords are badly swollen as part of the illness. That means doctors have often had to often perform tracheostomies, creating an opening in the neck to gain access to the windpipe, in order to remove the breathing tube that connects patents to the ventilator.""You've got to look after the tracheostomy, it's a wound in the neck,"" explains Carl Waldmann, a consultant in intensive care at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading.""So, it was a long, slow process getting them off the ventilator. It might take them a week or two weeks or even longer."" ""I was nearly a goner""And behind every observation lies a human story.Abraham Raskin's family were told in late April that it was unlikely he would survive. But on 12 June he finally left the Royal London Hospital after more than 50 days in intensive care, a tracheostomy, and a month in a medically induced coma.""The very fact that I'm alive now is a miracle,"" he says, ""I was nearly a goner.""On a video call arranged by nurses on 18 May his family saw his face for the first time since he was taken into hospital in early April. He wasn't able to say anything, but he did raise an eyebrow.Abraham was severely delirious for some time after waking up. ""I was talking all kinds of rubbish,"" he says.""Afterwards when I heard about what I was saying, I felt like I was mad or something. It's not pleasant.""But he is now back at home, still very tired, and following a basic exercise programme planned from him by a physiotherapist. With support from family members, he can get upstairs to sleep at night.  ""Some people can't really walk anymore when they come out of this,"" he says, ""and some take months to recover. I hope I'm not one of them.""DeliriumAs many as three-quarters of intensive care patients who need mechanical ventilation to help them breathe will suffer from delirium. And the observations of many doctors suggest that delirium has been particularly acute, and hallucinations unusually vivid, for people who fall critically ill with Covid-19.Delirium can be caused by the infection itself, and the fevers which accompany it. But it is intensified by the strong sedative drugs that have to be used to keep patients comfortable, and the unsettling environment of intensive care they find themselves in.While patients are in a coma, and after they wake up and begin withdrawing from these drugs, they often experience frightening hallucinations, and cling to unsettling beliefs about what is going on.""Delirium doesn't have a dreamlike quality,"" says Dorothy Wade, the principal health psychologist in intensive care at University College Hospital in London. ""Patients always say 'it was completely real - I was just living in this terrifying alternative reality.'""Doctors think that chemical imbalances prompt the brain to create its own explanation for why the body can't move and the patient can't speak. Often people think they've been kidnapped or tortured, or they think they're in a prison cell about to be put on trial.""They tend to feel that the nurses and the doctors and the staff are all in some conspiracy,"" says Dorothy Wade, ""that this is all part of a conspiracy to make money out of them by selling their blood or their organs.""It means that psychologists like Dr Wade try to step in as early as possible. It's important not to argue with delirious patients, she says, but instead to try to offer reassurance about what has really been happening.Simon Farrell left hospital relatively quickly after being taken off a ventilator, but he still recalls the vivid nature of the delirium he experienced.""I remember Elliott, my younger son, coming into the room in PPE,"" he says. ""Now, that clearly wasn't right. No children were allowed on the ward. The hospital was locked down. It didn't happen.""In his head at the time, though, he believed it to be absolutely true.""You just feel it is what's happening,"" he says. ""And there was a lot worse than that. That was a simple one.""SCHOOLS: When will children be returning?EXERCISE: What are the guidelines on getting out?THE R NUMBER: What it means and why it mattersAIR TRAVELLERS: The new quarantine rulesLOOK-UP TOOL: How many cases in your area?FamilyThe challenge of dealing with the acute delirium that accompanies Covid-19 has been heightened by the fact that family members can't be at the bedside when patients are trying to return to reality. Seriously ill people wake into a world of flashing lights and machines, of disrupted sleep and hospital staff in full PPE.""It has a huge impact on patients,"" explains Krystyna Walton, a consultant in rehabilitation medicine at the Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester. ""They are already confused, and it must be incredibly difficult.""""If somebody has suffered encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and they have memory problems or insight problems, they're not aware of the way that Covid has affected the world, so they can't understand why there are no visitors.""And the social isolation imposed by the pandemic also has repercussions for friends and family.Hannah Farrell, Simon's wife, works as a neuro physiotherapist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where he was a patient. She recalls one evening when he was still severely delirious, a nurse she knew rang and suggested that hearing her voice on the phone might calm Simon down.""Apparently, it settled Simon, but it certainly didn't settle me,"" she says. ""I didn't sleep all night, because Simon just didn't sound like Simon at all.""""For me, it was quite upsetting, and I'm sure other relatives have said the same.""Long-term problemsSome patients can still be delirious weeks after waking up.And delirium, says Kate Tantam, along with other frightening early experiences, ""is the key link to post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression"" among people who survive their time in ICU.Roughly one in five people who pass through intensive care in normal times go on to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). And the signs are that with Covid patients that number could be considerably higher.The same goes for more general anxiety and depression after leaving hospital. The extreme circumstances of the Covid pandemic, and the social isolation that has come with it, are likely to make things worse. The lack of a reassuring family presence, for example, continues to pose additional problems after patients are released from acute hospital wards into care homes and rehabilitation units. Hospitals have invested in iPads to facilitate contact, and family liaison teams make sure video calls take place every day, but it's not quite the same.Image copyrightGetty ImagesKrystyna Walton gives the example of one of her patients who had severe Covid pneumonia, as well as renal failure and dialysis. The patient spent several weeks in critical care, and several more on a medical ward before being moved to a rehabilitation ward with cognitive deficits. They have not been able to see their family for three months.Normally in a rehabilitation unit, staff would try to personalise a patient's surroundings and encourage them to wear their own clothes. But the restrictions surrounding Covid have prevented much of that. And because family members are unable to visit, or speak to medical staff face-to-face, they often struggle to understand just how sick their relative has been.""There are no visitors in care homes, there are no visitors in rehabilitation in the NHS or in the independent sector,"" says Krystyna Walton.""And even after leaving rehab there have been restrictions that we all have had to deal with, which makes it more difficult to visit a vulnerable person in their own home. All of this has a huge psychological impact.""So, the NHS is going to have to prepare for the possibility of a fresh wave of PTSD patients, just as it is trying to deal with a backlog of mental health (and other) cases which have been neglected during the worst of the pandemic. ""We won't know for several months how big a problem this is going to be,"" says Dorothy Wade.""To begin with people are very relieved to be out of hospital, especially after such a long stay. Sometimes it can take quite a long time for them to realise that something still isn't quite right.""It doesn't always turn out that way. Alongside post-traumatic stress, doctors acknowledge the concept of post-traumatic growth, and point to patients who emerge from critical care with a new outlook on life.""There are some people who - no matter how difficult this has been - find themselves in a more positive frame of mind,"" explains Julie Highfield, a consultant clinical psychologist based in intensive care units in Cardiff.""People feel this is a chance they never thought they would have, and they are determined to live their life well.""Simon Farrell is certainly trying to focus on the positive and he has been recovering week by week. But he admits it has to be tinged with realism.""I think people feel if they get physically stronger, they're then mentally stronger and they're fine. And that's not always the case. The two are not aligned.""Physical recoveryFor many people physical recovery can provide the biggest challenge, particularly if they have spent weeks in intensive care.""Covid is a nasty, nasty disease that kicks every single system you've got in the neck,"" says Kate Tantam.And sometimes when people wake up from four weeks of sedation, like thousands of Covid-19 patients have done, the only thing they can move is their fingertips.""We have to rebuild everything with them,"" she says, ""and teach them how to do everything physically again - from being able to feed yourself or being able to touch your hair, to being able to stand and being able to sit.""A prolonged period of recovery is not unusual after intensive care, but many Covid-19 patients have experienced particularly severe fatigue and muscle wasting. They are exhausted - sitting in a chair for half an hour might be followed by four hours sleep. And rebuilding muscle takes time.Image copyrightGetty Images""If we don't give patients the right level of nutritional input, they are not going to recover,"" Kate Tantam says.So, dieticians have an important role to play, alongside physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.  If you have just survived a multi-system disease which attacks different parts of the body in different ways, it stands to reason that you need various forms of help to recover.Many Covid patients will return to normal life relatively quickly. But some have suffered kidney failure and may require ongoing renal support, while others will need to be referred to cardiologists or may have developed neurological conditions that require specialist care.The challenge, says Carl Waldmann, ""is to make sure that everyone gets what they need, and that the right support can be provided at the right time.""""I think the greatest burden will be in the community,"" argues Krystyna Walton, ""because many of these patients will have quite subtle deficits that will only become evident to them as they start recovering physically, weeks and months after going home.""Breathlessness The most common physical challenge for recovering Covid-19 patients is shortness of breath - and that can apply to people who had moderate as well as severe symptoms of the disease.""For patients that are coming out of hospital,"" says Sally Singh, ""clearly they're breathless because they've had a respiratory disease. Their lungs are temporarily damaged, but they are also deconditioned because they've been lying in a hospital bed for so long that they've become pretty unfit.""It means that simple things like going up and down stairs can become extremely challenging, especially in elderly patients.But breathlessness is an issue that goes well beyond survivors of intensive care. And a significant minority of people who've been infected with the coronavirus are still struggling to shake it off.""I'd crash in a heap""Jenny Goldblatt, an infectious diseases doctor at the Royal Free Hospital, fell ill with Covid-19 in March and it has lingered ever since - returning in waves of fatigue, chest pains and breathing difficulties.She spent a couple of days in hospital in March, where she was given a little extra oxygen. But it was only after going home that her problems began in earnest.""Every 10 days or so I'd start to feel a little better and I'd start to go for longer walks,"" she says. ""But then I'd crash in a heap and couldn't get out of bed for a week.""It was a month after falling ill that she first managed to walk to the end of the road and back. A keen cyclist, her next goal is to cycle around the block.""I can't imagine when I will be able to take my bike for a proper ride, and if I think about that too much it gets a bit depressing.""Jenny thinks she has cleared the virus, and she has ""easily detectable"" antibodies in her blood, but her body is continuing to react in unusual ways. Post-viral fatigue is not unique to Covid-19, but this is something more.Jenny has suffered chest pains and breathlessness; other patients with lingering symptoms report severe headaches or abdominal pains. Three months after falling ill, going back to work or resuming normal life is out of the question.""I am getting better slowly,"" she says, ""but I can't be too ambitious. It is frustrating to be on this rollercoaster, with absolutely no idea how long the journey will take.""ChallengesPrevious medical experience with pneumonia suggests it can take months, or in extreme cases years, for patients to get back to where they were before. With Covid-19, we are still early in the cycle of rehabilitation and recovery, and every patient is different.""The honest answer is we don't yet know how long it will take,"" says Sally Singh. ""People are researching that as we speak - monitoring chest x-rays, symptoms and the wellbeing of patients to help us identify what the best intervention to support these people may be.""The trouble is the provision of rehabilitation services across the country can be patchy, especially for people emerging from critical care. And the NHS is already dealing with a massive backlog of non-Covid cases that have been delayed.""The huge challenge,"" says Krystyna Walton, ""is going to be the increase in numbers.""At the peak of the outbreak the priority was to get patients out of acute hospital settings quickly to free up bed space. That means in many cases the rehabilitation assessments that would normally be done in hospital would have been done in the community, or in a care home or a non-specialist rehabilitation setting.Image copyrightGetty Images""And my suspicion,"" Krystyna Walton adds, ""is that many patients may have not had their needs assessed properly.""Carl Waldmann, who has been working on improving the rehabilitation of seriously ill patients for more than 25 years, says one of the best analogies he can think of is building a rocket, and training an astronaut. ""You put them up into space, but you also have to think about where they're going to land and what we're going to do when they get back.""It is the same, he says, if you put a patient through the complexities of intensive care.""We've had some patients who need seven specialists looking after them afterwards,"" he says, ""and unless they have all those bits of the jigsaw puzzle, there is a chance they won't make the recovery they could have made.""It is important to emphasise those rehabilitation needs don't stop after the immediate recovery period. Many patients will suffer from scarring of the lungs - a permanent and often debilitating condition. Doctors also know that a significant number of people who have been critically ill have suffered cognitive deficits. Ideally they should have screening for return to driving a vehicle, and for return to work. ""Rehabilitation has to sort of blur into real life and getting back out into the community,"" says Krystyna Walton, ""doing what you used to do before, looking after your family, earning an income, enjoying leisure facilities and exercise.""""And that is what takes time and expertise.""The NHS and individual hospitals are of course building rehabilitation into their Covid recovery plans, but this is a system that has been overlooked for years. Experts in the field hope, despite all the pressures, that Covid will provide a launch pad for change.""Hospitals are very good at treating people, doing something to somebody to make them better,"" says Kate Tantam. ""But what they are not always very good at is prioritising the therapeutic and rehabilitation input afterwards.""It is, in other words, not just about survival, it is about health-related quality of life.""There is no point giving somebody a massive intensive care stay, if you don't try to return them to where they want to be.""Additional reporting: Oliver BarnesIllustrations: Emma LynchYou may also be interested in:When you talk to intensive care doctors across the UK, exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of Covid-19, one phrase emerges time after time: ""We've never seen anything like this before.""They knew a new disease was coming, and they were expecting resources to be stretched by an unknown respiratory infection which had first appeared in China at the end of last year.And as the number of cases increased, doctors up and down the UK were reading first-hand accounts from colleagues in China, and then in Italy - in scientific journals and on social media - about the intensity of infection.""It felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the D-Day landings,"" says Barbara Miles, clinical director of intensive care at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, ""with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing"".But what arrived in the UK as winter turned into spring took even the most experienced ICU specialists by surprise. Read how doctors on the front lines are observing things that they have never encountered before - and it's a challenge."

It might be infrared temperature checks in the lobby, contactless lifts, or new apps to spread workers out and keep shared surfaces clean, but there's no doubt the post-coronavirus office is getting a drastic technological refit.More Technology of BusinessFinding the 'invisible' millions who are not on mapsHow much does your boss know about you?When working from home is much more than emailingCreating an online course 'changed my life'The hidden detectors looking for knives and gunsIt could all start as soon as you wake up in the morning. You may check your building app, says David Garten, vice president at RXR Realty which owns and manages 93 properties in the New York area. The firm's new app creates a building health index each day, from information like air quality, the number of occupants, and how well social distancing is being observed.  If your building has a low rating that day, you might decide to work from home, or go to a smaller satellite office instead.The app will also tell you the ideal time to arrive, to reduce congestion, and people riding public transport at peak times. ""So the ideal time for me to walk through our lobby is 10am,"" says Mr Garten.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Fever screening is a common sight                Then on entering, you may pass through an infrared fever-screening system, says James Lawrence of Gensler, a large design and architecture firm based in San Francisco. FLIR Systems, one Oregon company that makes these crowd thermal cameras, has seen its demand increase 700%.If a concierge judges you high risk from the infrared screening, they might double-check your temperature with a handheld device. Then, you might need to have your meeting by video conference from a quarantine room, or take a car home or to hospital.If you make it through the lobby, then perhaps you will operate the lift with buttons on your app. Once upstairs, it will tell you when your workstation was last cleaned, Mr Garten says.When it gets to lunchtime, you'll order food by an app, says John Robson, asset director at Workspace, which has 69 office properties around London focusing mainly on small companies.Image copyrightWorkspaceImage caption                    Workers will probably have to spread out more                ""Every transaction is cashless now, and your food will basically be grab and go,"" he says.If you pop to the loo after lunch, you'll be increasingly looking at touchless taps, Mr Lawrence says.New software is helping companies spread people out.Gensler's tool ReRun imports floor plans, calculates safe bubbles around each worker, and then outputs different ways to place workers so their bubbles do not overlap.""Recently we did an analysis on a two million square-foot building that took roughly 10 days to turn around. Otherwise it would've taken several weeks,"" says Mr Lawrence.For the same reason, some companies are looking to teach artificial intelligence (AI) to video cameras.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Artificial intelligence can look for office ""pinch points""                AI algorithms can offer feedback about ""pinch points"" where people are too close together, while protecting individual privacy, says Dr Mahesh Saptharishi, Motorola Solutions' chief technology officer, based in Boston.Instead of watching the actual video, they can ask the AI how well social distancing is being observed overall, and where problem points are. ""So employees don't feel someone's watching what they do,"" he says.Meanwhile, your cleaner might well be employee of the month for many months to come.An April study in The Lancet Microbe showed the virus can last on plastic and stainless steel (like door handles) for up to seven days, and glass (like screens) for four days.Cleaning wipes can disrupt the layer of fat that surrounds and protects coronavirus. And bleach's active ingredient sodium hypochlorite destroys the crown of protein spikes that gives the virus its name, and the ribonucleic acid (RNA) which is its blueprint to reproduce. So does the ethanol in surgical spirits.But it would be helpful to know which surfaces should be cleaned.Contact tracing needs to keep track of the surfaces and facilities you and sick colleagues used, says Matt Calkins, head of US software development platform Appian, which has also made coronavirus workplace safety software.If you know which of your rooms to target, you know where best to send your deep cleaning team, and maximise use of your bleach, ethanol and wipes, Mr Calkins says.The virus can also be carried in the air, on water droplets or fine dust particles, say researchers. So what about air conditioning systems?Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Office owners will be working hard to make their buildings attractive                The UK government says the risk of air conditioning spreading coronavirus in the workplace is ""extremely low"".Nevertheless, ""we're advising organisations to look at their air conditioning system,"" says Dr Mark Parrish, Northern European medical director from International SOS, which advises companies about medical risks.Filters with extremely narrow openings - like high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and the more powerful ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) ones - can remove coronavirus from circulating in the air, according to UK air filter manufacturer SPCB.The problem is such ventilation systems will normally need stronger fans to push air through these narrower filters, it says.Upgrading air conditioning could be one of many options used by office owners to keep their tenants happy.Maciej Markowski of spaceOS says simple convenience might be the winning factor.""It's ridiculous that you're in a building and it's easier to order food from across town than the restaurant downstairs. Or with three taps on your phone you can tell Amazon a package is broken, but there's no way to tell your building there's a huge spill in front of your office."""

There's only a handful of staff in the factory. Half the building is in darkness.The boss is stranded in Europe. They haven't had any new orders from their American customers for months.This is a business that's desperately trying to keep the lights on.""Up until now we haven't received any substantial mass production orders to keep the factory running and to be able to pay salaries and to be able to stay afloat,"" Yuliya Yakubova told me. She was blunt about the business she runs.Speaking from Italy she said, ""The last [thing] I want to do really is fire or let go employees."" But she doesn't have long left.Lotus United is a business that's hanging on. In an industrial park in Jiangsu near China's east coast it makes the rails and the racks for the shops that some of you go to. Or at least it used to.Two floors of manufacturing, around 100 employees, have been reduced to only a handful of staff turning up every day.Most of the machines are now switched off, cardboard boxes stacked up, piles of rusty inventory on the floor.How bad are China's economic woes?China's virus-hit economy shrinks for first time in decadesHuang Xuefeng is not very busy. Before we met there were a few sparks flying over in a corner. The white glow of welding at a workbench.Pay cutsBut the disastrous shutdown brought by the virus has reduced this company to a handful of workers, tucked away in a corner.Huang's had a 50% pay cut. He's now spending the equivalent of just over $200 (£160) a month.""The money I earn now can only guarantee basic living,"" he said. His family has been hit hard because his wife works at the factory too.They are a tiny, tiny part of China's vast wave of migrant workers.When I met him they were eating lunch together during a 25-minute break.If the company goes under they'll lose their pay, and their free lunch.

But they are particularly vulnerable in this crisis.In recent years the government and the Communist Party has been more focused on consolidating and protecting state-owned enterprises: the industrial, transport, telecoms and financial giants that they own.Add to this small companies' over-reliance on doing business in the US - it only has American customers - and it is clear that Lotus is very, very vulnerable. One hundred jobs are on the line.Employment of 'paramount importance'An impending unemployment crisis is the stuff of nightmares for China's leaders. The ruling Communist Party worries incessantly about the effects on social stability.Small but visible protests sprang up in Wuhan in April. Workers in a shopping centre gathered to demonstrate against rents they could no longer afford.The official jobless total in China's cities has already hit the government's target. There are independent forecasts that it could go much higher.Image caption                    Only a handful of Lotus United's 100 employees are still working                China's number two politician, Premier Li Keqiang, acknowledged the scale of the problem last month when he said: ""The truth is that in April that figure already hit 6%... Employment is the biggest concern in people's lives. It is something of paramount importance for all families.""Addressing workers at firms like Lotus, Mr Li said: ""Many export companies have no orders now, which has greatly affected their employees.""We must provide support to all these people and businesses in difficulties, but most importantly, we must help them land jobs.""But there is one group the party is particularly worried about: graduates.Under pressureThere are almost nine million graduates entering China's job market this summer.There are fewer jobs to go round. Mr Li has admitted the outlook for them is ""grim"".Image caption                    Zhang does not expect the jobs situation to improve for graduates within a year                Outside a recruitment fair in Shanghai, 23-year-old Zhang told us: ""Yes, we have pressure. We can't find jobs but also we don't want to stay at home doing nothing.""She is pessimistic. ""I expect it won't get better within a year.""Many of the job fairs have gone online. Graduates are looking down a phone camera with a mask on hoping to land their first big job. ""We don't have any internship experience and we didn't go to the autumn job fair,"" Zhang explained.In China's past, the government used to assign jobs to them. But that is long gone.Provincial governments and state-owned firms are being encouraged to recruit graduates. There are tax breaks on offer.This is a critical issue for economic recovery and political legitimacy. Young, educated, unemployed, restless and resentful graduates have repeatedly been a problem for the ruling party.Image caption                    If Huang Xuefeng loses his job in the factory, he will return to farming                Back at the factory, via Italy, Ms Yakubova has her chin up. ""I am hopeful that after one, two, I don't know, three months, let's say in the near future, that we can restart.""Some staff have already quit to find other work. The minimum wage she was forced to put them on was not enough.Huang and his wife are staying, but they have a plan. ""We are under great pressure to live here,"" he said. ""The rent, the cost of living... if we can't hold on we will leave.""They will go back up north if the jobs end, and become corn and wheat farmers again.Millions of migrant workers like them could do the same.

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53305721,What is bubonic plague?,Michelle Roberts,['6 July 2020'],"Image copyrightGetty ImagesA suspected case of bubonic plague has been reported to Chinese authorities. It is not known how the patient became infected, but the country is on alert for more cases.Plague is one of the deadliest diseases in human history - but it can now be easily treated with antibiotics.What is bubonic plague?Plague is a potentially lethal infectious disease that is caused by bacteria called Yersinia pestis that live in some animals - mainly rodents - and their fleas. Bubonic plague is the most common form of the disease that people can get. The name comes from the symptoms it causes - painful, swollen lymph nodes or 'buboes' in the groin or armpit. From 2010 to 2015 there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths.Historically, it has also been called the Black Death, in reference to the gangrenous blackening and death of body parts, such as the fingers and toes, that can happen with the illness. What does it do?A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague between two and six days after being infected. Along with the tender, enlarged lymph nodes, that can be as large as a chicken egg, other symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and tiredness. Plague can also affect the lungs, causing a cough, chest pain and difficulty breathing. The bacteria can also enter the bloodstream and cause a condition called septicaemia or sepsis, which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure and death. How can you catch it? People can catch it from:Bites of infected fleasTouching infected animals such as rats and miceInhaling infected respiratory droplets spread by infected people or animalsDomestic cats and dogs can become infected from flea bites or from eating infected rodents. The infection could also enter the body through a cut in the skin if the person came in close contact with an infected animal's blood.The current alert in China forbids the hunting and eating of animals that could carry plague. The body of someone who has died after being infected with plague can infect people who are in close contact, such as those who are preparing the body for burial. Is there a treatment or a cure for it?Prompt treatment with antibiotics is vital. The disease is often lethal if left. Early diagnosis, using laboratory tests on blood and other body samples, can save lives. Could there be a new outbreak or pandemic?Plague still exists in many parts of the world. In recent years there have been outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Madagascar. Although plague has been the cause of widespread disease outbreaks in medieval times, any outbreaks today are thankfully small.Dr Matthew Dryden, consultant microbiologist at the University of Southampton in the UK, said: ""It is good that this has been picked up and reported at an early stage because it can be isolated, treated and spread prevented. ""Bubonic plague is caused by a bacterium and so, unlike Covid-19, is readily treated with antibiotics. So although this might appear alarming, being another major infectious disease emerging from the East, it appears to be a single suspected case which can be readily treated."""

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53181555,Coronavirus: How fast is it spreading in Africa?,Peter Mwai,['7 July 2020'],"Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Nigeria has been one of the worst-affected countries                Africa is seeing coronavirus cases rapidly increasing and deaths rising, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).We've looked at the situation across the continent, and examined which countries are of most concern.How fast is coronavirus spreading?In terms of overall numbers, Africa currently accounts for only a small proportion of total global cases, but the acceleration in rates of infection in some countries is clearly a cause for concern.While it took nearly 100 days for Africa to reach an initial 100,000 cases, it took only 18 days for that to double to 200,000. It doubled again to 400,000 cases over the next 20 days.The upward trend in Africa is starting to resemble other parts of the world that have been badly hit by the coronavirus. Most African countries are now experiencing community transmission, according to the WHO.This is when a person gets Covid-19 without having been in contact with a known case from abroad or a confirmed domestic case, which makes it hard for for the authorities to track down the source of a local outbreak.Where are Africa's hotspots?The two countries with the highest numbers of cases are South Africa and Egypt. They accounted for over 60% of all the new cases reported in late June.South Africa has the highest recorded number of total cases, while Egypt has the largest number of recorded coronavirus deaths.South Africa, which imposed one of the world's strictest lockdowns in late March, has seen cases rise steadily after this was relaxed in early May.The Western Cape province (where Cape Town is located), accounts for nearly half of all cases in the country and more than half of the deaths. But cases are steadily rising in Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg.Egypt has seen case numbers rising rapidly since mid-May, but there are indications that this may now have reached a peak with recorded new infections levelling off slightly in early July.There is also concern about what is happening in Nigeria, which recorded the second-highest increase in deaths from Covid-19 after South Africa in the WHO report for 1 July.                    mapped                Confirmed cases around the worldZoom toThe worldAfricaNorth AmericaLatin America & CaribbeanAsiaEuropeMiddle

East Africa.In fact, the latest WHO Africa region report said just 10 countries accounted for more than 80% of all the reported cases on the continent.How many people are dying in Africa?The overall

Due to revisions in the number of cases, an average cannot be calculated for this date.

Current analysis suggests a lower mortality rate in younger people. But there are still five countries with death rates that are comparable to or higher than the most recent global average rate of 5% deaths from confirmed cases: Chad (8.5%)Algeria (6.6%)Niger (6.2%)Burkina Faso (5.5%)Mali (5.3)Githinji Gitahi, the head of Amref Health Africa, an NGO which specialises in health matters, says the higher rates could be an indication of much higher infection levels than those being recorded, but it could also be as a result of relatively low levels of testing. The fewer tests you carry out, the fewer confirmed cases you find, and so the number of deaths appears relatively high.The WHO says using community surveillance, where community health workers and other frontline staff report Covid-19 deaths, could be behind the high death rate reported, for example, in Chad.How much testing is done in Africa?Ten countries account for about 80% of the total tests conducted - South Africa, Morocco, Ghana, Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda, Mauritius, Kenya, Nigeria and Rwanda.There are wide variations in testing rates, with South Africa doing the most and Nigeria doing relatively few, according to Our World in Data, a UK-based project which collates Covid-19 information.On 4 July, South Africa was doing just over 30 tests per 1,000 people, compared with 72 in the UK and 105 in the US. Nigeria is achieving 0.7 tests per 1,000 people, Ghana 10 and Kenya 3.It's worth pointing out that for some African countries, it is impossible to know what exactly is happening due to a lack of any data or data being incomplete.""We have to take the numbers with a pinch of salt,"" says Chiedo Nwankwor, a lecturer in African affairs at Johns Hopkins University in the US.In Tanzania, President John Magufuli has voiced doubts about the validity of virus testing results at the national laboratory, and has allowed only limited data on infection rates and testing to be made public. Equatorial Guinea had a row with the WHO after accusing its country representative of inflating the number of Covid-19 cases.  For a while it held back its data, but has now started sharing it again.And in Kano state in northern Nigeria, an unusual spike of close to 1,000 deaths was reported in late April, but the government has not still confirmed how many were due to Covid-19.Note: The graphics in this page use a different source for figures for France from that used by Johns Hopkins University, which results in a slightly lower overall total.

It claimed to be from an unknown group calling itself the Homeland Cheetahs.The group said it had attacked the major Iranian nuclear site at Natanz some two hours earlier, at 02:00 local time. In the detailed message, it claimed it had blown up a facility and that the Iranian regime would not be able to hide it.The group said it was composed of dissidents within Iran's military and security forces and that they had been behind numerous attacks that the Iranian authorities had so far concealed from the public.I went online to check Iranian news agencies and reliable accounts on social media, but I found no mention of such an attack anywhere.Several hours later, Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation announced there had been an incident at the Natanz nuclear plant, but they ruled out sabotage. Interactive                Incident at Natanz nuclear site                        3 July                        1 July            The next day, Iran's Supreme National Security Council - its top security body - announced that it knew what caused the ""incident"" at Natanz but that ""for security reasons"" it would not for the time being say what this was.Nasa satellite images showed there had been a fire at Natanz at 02:06. The damage corresponded with details contained in the email from the Homeland Cheetahs.The group's message had been carefully crafted and included a propaganda video about attacks on strategic sites it said it had carried out inside Iran. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 wordsWhy do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter?Iranians on Trump and the nuclear dealPreparing this kind of statement and video requires hours, if not days, of planning. Whoever authored it knew about the Natanz explosion in advance, which supports the theory that it was an act of sabotage. But there is also the possibility that the email was an elaborate attempt to mislead us as to who was behind the attack, and could actually be the work of foreign agents posing as opponents of the regime in Iran.Attack 'thwarted'The group's name, the Homeland Cheetahs, is similar to those of other ""Iranian"" cyber groups, such as Persian Cat,  or Charming Kitten - teams of hackers believed to be part of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Cyber Army. It is possible that the Homeland Cheetahs were born to confront the Persian Cat. Image caption                    Israel says it foiled an attempt to sabotage its water system                In late May, national cyber security in Israel - Iran's arch-foe - said the country had prevented a major cyber attack on its water system, widely thought to have been the work of Iran.Days later, there was a cyber attack on Shahid Rajaae, an important economic and shipping hub in southern Iran.More than 50% of Iran's sea imports and exports take place through this harbour. The attack caused a massive blockage of water in the canals and flooded roads leading to the terminal. Iranian officials blamed power shortages, but Western intelligence sources believe it was Israeli retaliation against Iran.Fires and blastsIn the past three months there have been an increasing number of mysterious incidents which have damaged sensitive sites in Iran.Numerous fires have broken out in nuclear facilities, oil refineries, power plants, major factories and businesses across the country.

Just a day earlier, Israel's foreign minister responded obliquely when asked if Israel was behind the incident, saying ""our actions in Iran better left unsaid"".   Israel does not normally take responsibility for these kinds of ""attacks"", and Iranian officials have avoided blaming Israel directly.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53244843,Coronavirus: Disease detectives track an invisible culprit,Tara McKelvey,['6 July 2020'],"Image copyrightGetty ImagesDisease detectives are trying desperately to beat the clock and find those who have been exposed to the virus. Can they move fast enough to stop the pandemic? As a public-health director in Savannah, Georgia, Cristina Pasa Gibson spent her time in an office filled with calorie counters and yoga mats and the scent of jasmine tea. Then she started working on contact tracing, a no-holds-barred effort to stop the pandemic, and her office and her life were turned upside down. ""I felt like I was in a Vegas casino,"" she says. ""I didn't know what time it was, what day it was, who I was.""She and her colleagues in Savannah and her counterparts in other cities across the country have been working frantically to trace the path of the infection and to find those who may have been exposed to the virus. They talk to patients, asking for names of individuals they have spent time with, and chase down those individuals and to tell them to remain isolated so they do not infect others. The pressure on investigators and contact tracers has been intense. ""I basically lived in my office,"" says Gibson, describing the early days. ""It was Groundhog Day over and over.""  Today their role is even more important. The US now has the highest number of cases and deaths in the world. Red State, Blue StateGibson is grappling with the pandemic, and she and her colleagues are trying to use contact tracing as a way to contain the virus. Her counterparts in New Haven, Connecticut, a city that lies almost 900 miles to the north, are also working feverishly to track the disease. Yale University student Tyler Shelby, 26, the son of a Kansas police detective and a fan of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes (played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a BBC version), helped to organise an investigative squad and coordinates dozens of volunteers.Image copyrightCourtesy of ShelbyImage caption                    Tyler Shelby, shown above at the Connecticut shore, helped put together a contact-tracing team                Cristina Pasa Gibson of Savannah and Tyler Shelby of New Haven are struggling with life-or-death matters in a country where people are deeply divided in their views of the pandemic and how the government should manage the health crisis. The number of cases has shot up in Georgia, Florida, Texas and other states where governors tried to reinforce Trump's message about the nation's economic comeback. Meanwhile the number of cases in Connecticut, New York and other northern states, places initially hit hard by the virus, has gone down.The contact-tracing initiatives in New Haven and Savannah are far from perfect. But they have been recognised by experts in the field as programmes that were started early and run with vigour. Taken together, these two programmes offer a snapshot of the high-stakes drama of contact tracing and show how the system is being put in place in both the northern and the southern parts of the country. Uncovering secret livesGibson spoke recently on the phone in her Savannah office with someone who had tested positive: ""He asked me: 'Am I going to die?' That's a terrible question to be faced with because so much is unknown. I could not give that person a definite answer."" Talking to people on the phone when they are scared and anxious is hard. In addition, the people who work in contact tracing have to find out key information from those who have gotten sick.Image caption                    Cristina Pasa Gibson, shown at her parents' house in Gainesville, Virginia, beats drumsticks in a workout class to reduce pandemic stress                Investigators and contact tracers try to find out whom the patients spoke to during a two-day period before they became ill and for the period of time beyond that - until they isolated themselves from others. That means recalling anyone they saw for more than 15 minutes and who stood or sat within six feet of them. Did you see a movie, take an Uber or go to church? If so - did you stop for donuts? an investigator may ask, according to a government report on contact-tracing programmes. The challenges are immense: ""You're asking people to think back,"" says Yale student Tyler Shelby. This raises the possibility for potentially awkward conversations: ""You don't necessarily need to specify who they slept with. It's really just anybody that meets that criteria"", or the guidelines that define close contact as anyone within six feet of you.What's behind alarming new US outbreaks? Is the pandemic getting worse in the US?The conversations with a patient on the phone can be tough, with long silences. ""Definitely people can have hesitation,"" Shelby says.  ""My first call - I was really nervous,"" says Yale student Paulina Luna Martinez, who is 27. She soon found it easy to speak with the people, though, and spends about a half-hour with each: ""They talk about their lives.""  She and the other volunteers send back the lists of contacts they have compiled, and a separate group of people tracks down the individuals on these lists, men and women who have been exposed to the virus. One of the most important aspects of contact tracing is helping those who are struggling. People who test positive need to stay separated from others, but they may need help. Those who have been exposed to the virus but remain healthy may not have enough money to see them through two weeks of isolation. As Columbia University's Patrick Kachur, explains, offering help to those who are sick and trying to protect others from the virus is one of the most important aspects of contact tracing. ""People think: 'This has to work because this is a key to getting back our lives,"" he says. ""But it's more than just counting cases and closing investigations. It's putting people in touch with the services they need."" Image copyrightCourtesy of familyImage caption                    ""My first call - I was really nervous."" says Paulina Luna Martinez, shown above on the left, with housemate Elsie Gonzalez in New Haven                In New Haven and Savannah, the investigators and contact tracers help people contact officials with social-service agencies if they need a place to stay during quarantine or would like someone to deliver groceries. In Nevada, says Adriane Casalotti, a spokeswoman for the National Association of County and City Health Officials, they feed their horses.Running against the clockContact tracing has a long history - the system was used to stop the spread of syphilis in the US in the 1930s. More recently, tracers ferreted out cases of Ebola in West Africa and other countries and helped beat back the disease. Yet contact tracing has never been used on a virus as ferocious as Covid-19, on such a broad scale, and these factors have helped to expose shortcomings in the tracing system. In England, the inefficiencies of the NHS Test and Trace, as the contact tracing programme is known, have been exposed by the BBC and other media.What went wrong with the coronavirus app?Analysts at the Center for Health Security say that the cost of the contact tracing, if done properly across the nation, would be steep: $3.6b USD.  Yet only some of the resources are available. According to NPR, about 37,000 tracers have so far been assigned to the taskNew Haven and Savannah are both about the same size. New Haven has a population of about 130,000, and Savannah has a population of 145,000. But Cristina Pasa Gibson and Tyler Shelby and others who live in these two cities have experienced the pandemic in different ways. Image copyrightCourtesy of Mark AbrahamImage caption                    DataHaven's Mark Abraham, right, with his son in New Haven during a stay-at-home order, maps areas where the virus has struck                New Haven, a city once known for its manufacturing industry and now for its university, Yale, is close to the New York epicentre. For many New Yorkers, New Haven is the end of the line, the place where they step off the train. In April, New Haven officials were reporting 20-35 new cases each week per 10,000 people, according to DataHaven, a nonprofit organisation, a spike that was caused partly by people from New York. By late June, more than 1,070 people had died of the disease in New Haven and the surrounding county.Savannah is a port city far from the coronavirus hotspots. In April, while Cristina Pasa Gibson and her colleagues were organising their team, they had fewer cases to manage. Officials in Savannah and the surrounding Chatham County reported only one or two new cases each week per 10,000 people, according to DataHaven. By late June, 37 people in Chatham County had died.  The number of cases in New Haven started to drop in the springtime. Slowly, though, cases in Savannah and Chatham County began to climb. The explanation for the disparity in infection rates between New Haven and Savannah are varied and complex. Geography plays a role, but so do decisions made by political leaders. The Republican governor of Georgia and the leaders of other states in the southern part of the country rushed to restart their economies. The Democratic governor of Connecticut and leaders of other northern states waited.  New Haven embodies the northern model - investigators and tracers were quickly deployed in large numbers (more than 150 were put in rotation, and they have since merged with a statewide group of several hundred). Savannah reflects the southern model of contact tracing and review of cases: their 49-member team is leaner. Image copyrightReutersImage caption                    Activists in Texas protest against contact tracing programmes                Albert Ko, a professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health who serves on a state board, the Reopen Connecticut Advisory Group, says the New Haven team is doing an above-average job. Experts have also praised the efforts in Savannah. In both cities, though, investigators are struggling to contact people fast enough. They are floundering in other ways too. The Savannah team members often find themselves without a Spanish speaker and rely on a Spanish-language phone line. In New Haven, they only managed to conduct interviews with 64% of the individuals they tried to contact, according to an epidemiologist with the New Haven health department.  Investigators and tracers should be able to contact 90% of patients within a day of hearing that they have the virus, according to the industry standard. Still, says Patrick Kachur, a Columbia University professor who used to work for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a programme like the one in New Haven has value. ""It's two-thirds of the way to 90%,"" Kachur says. ""Even if it can't be done perfectly, it's still worth doing."" Looking for cluesLast winter Tyler Shelby, who is studying for both a Yale medical degree and a public-health doctorate, was working at a cubicle decorated with potted vines and getting ready to go to Uganda on a Fulbright scholarship. Then he started seeing news about Covid-19 on Reddit. ""I thought: I'm needed right here,"" he says. He began working with his colleagues on a contact-tracing programme.

Their heroes are amateur sleuths on true-crime podcasts and legendary figures such as Watson, the sidekick to the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. Watson could always ""go with the flow"", says Shelby: ""He puts up with Holmes, but he's observant himself.""The disease detectives are a diverse lot: working with Shelby, Yale medical student Paulina Luna Martinez began calling patients from her group house in New Haven. Maritza Bond, the city's public-health director, studied a heat map of her old neighbourhood, Fair Haven, an area filled with Puerto Rican families that became a Covid hot spot, and epidemiologist Brian Weeks tracked data (""I like to make sense of things,"" he says). Savannah epidemiologist Meredith Avery started working in a small-town pharmacy at 16, and Cristina Pasa Gibson used to take care of laboratory monkeys. The successes or failures of the disease detectives in the two cities hold lessons for those around the world.During her morning commute from Statesboro, a town that is about an hour's drive from Savannah, Avery listens to Crime Junkie. She has a keen interest in investigations, both criminal and epidemiological, and says that she felt uneasy in the early days of the pandemic and a bit excited too. ""You learn about these things in school,"" says 30-year-old Avery. ""And you think it's never going to happen here."" Contact tracers in Singapore used CCTV footage to track down people who were exposed to the virus. South Korean authorities constructed ""virtual nets"" around individuals to protect others from the virus, according to the Hill.How Singapore stayed one step ahead of the virusBut most people in the US baulk at contact-tracing apps, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, because of privacy concerns. Thurmond Neill Tillman, a pastor at First African Baptist Church in Savannah, says he understands the need for contact tracing: three people in his congregation have become ill with the virus. But he is concerned about the system's invasive nature. ""I can see how it would be very troubling,"" he says. ""I probably would have hated it as a teenager.""Image copyrightCourtesy of First African Baptist ChurchImage caption                    Pastor Thurmond Neill Tillman supports contact tracing but says the system raises privacy issues                Empathy lessonsDetectives are good listeners. They try to win the trust of people, and the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes is helpful. Cristina Pasa Gibson, 50, says she learned about cultural differences as a five-year-old while visiting her cousin in Manila. They came across an illustration of an egg basket in a colouring book, and her cousin painted one of the eggs dark, making it look like an egg soaked in slaked lime, a snack in the Philippines. ""I said: 'There's no such thing as a purple egg,' and I hit her,"" Gibson says. ""I was such a spoiled brat. That began my introspective journey."" Outside of Manila, Gibson saw families living in poverty, with ramshackle huts as homes, and decided in college to work in public health. The experience she had as a child have helped her in her work fighting the pandemic: she understands that not everyone sees the world in the same way, and they are fighting the virus in different ways too.A SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?UPLIFTING STORY: '' I got a life-changing opportunity in lockdown'MEETING FRIENDS: How can I do that safely?GLOBAL TAKE:  Which country has the most generous bailout?THE LOST SIX WEEKS: Missed chances for US to contain outbreakDisease detectives are now settling into their roles.

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51214864,Coronavirus: What it does to the body,James Gallagher,['14 March 2020'],"Image copyrightGetty Images The coronavirus emerged in only December last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - Covid-19.For most, the disease is mild, but some people die. So how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated?Incubation periodThis is when the virus is establishing itself.Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them.The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face.It first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into ""coronavirus factories"" that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells. At this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms. The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionEverything you need to know about the coronavirus – explained in one minute by the BBC's Laura FosterMild diseaseThis is all most people will experience. Covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough. Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed.The fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. It has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines.These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever.The coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus. Some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. You won't need specialist hospital care.  This stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus.However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19.This is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too.EASY STEPS: How to keep safeA SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?WHO'S AT RISK: Are women and children less affected?CONTAINMENT: What it means to self-isolateMAPS AND CHARTS: Visual guide to the outbreakVIDEO: The 20-second hand washSevere diseaseIf the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus. Those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. Too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body. ""The virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know,"" said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London.Image copyrightSPLImage caption                    Scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia                Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia. If it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs.This is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe. This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China.Critical diseaseIt is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill.By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death. The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body. It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely. Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive.  It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines.""The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania said.And if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage. Treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ECMO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in.But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive. The first deathsDoctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts.The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs. The first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital.He was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating.He died 11 days after he was admitted.The second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome.He was attached to an ECMO machine but this wasn't enough. He died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed.Follow James on Twitter."
https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51963486,Coronavirus: When will the outbreak end and life get back to normal?,James Gallagher,['23 March 2020'],"Image copyrightGetty ImagesThe world is shutting down. Places that were once teeming with the hustle and bustle of daily life have become ghost-towns with massive restrictions put on our lives - from lockdowns and school closures to travel restrictions and bans on mass gatherings.It is an unparalleled global response to a disease. But when will it end and when will we be able to get on with our lives?Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he believes the UK can ""turn the tide"" against the outbreak within the next 12 weeks and the country can ""send coronavirus packing"".But even if the number of cases starts to fall in the next three months, then we will still be far from the end.It can take a long time for the tide to go out - possibly years.It is clear the current strategy of shutting down large parts of society is not sustainable in the long-term. The social and economic damage would be catastrophic.What countries need is an ""exit strategy"" - a way of lifting the restrictions and getting back to normal.But the coronavirus is not going to disappear. If you lift the restrictions that are holding the virus back, then cases will inevitably soar. ""We do have a big problem in what the exit strategy is and how we get out of this,"" says Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh.""It's not just the UK, no country has an exit strategy.""It is a massive scientific and societal challenge.A SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?NEW GUIDANCE: What must I do?NEW RESTRICTIONS: What are they?LOOK-UP TOOL: Check cases in your areaMAPS AND CHARTS: Visual guide to the outbreakThere are essentially three ways out of this mess.vaccinationenough people develop immunity through infectionor permanently change our behaviour/society Each of these routes would reduce the ability of the virus to spread. Vaccines - at least 12-18 months awayA vaccine should give someone immunity so they do not become sick if they are exposed. Immunise enough people, about 60% of the population, and the virus cannot cause outbreaks - the concept known as herd immunity.The first person was given an experimental vaccine in the US this week after researchers were allowed to skip the usual rules of performing animal tests first.Vaccine research is taking place at unprecedented speed, but there is no guarantee it will be successful and will require immunisation on a global scale. The best guess is a vaccine could still be 12 to 18-months away if everything goes smoothly. That is a long time to wait when facing unprecedented social restrictions during peacetime. ""Waiting for a vaccine should not be honoured with the name 'strategy', that is not a strategy,"" Prof Woolhouse told the BBC.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    A cough is one of the symptoms of Covid-19                Natural immunity - at least two years awayThe UK's short-term strategy is to drive down cases as much as possible to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed - when you run out of intensive care beds then deaths spike.Once cases are suppressed, it may allow some measures to be lifted for a while - until cases rise and another round of restrictions are needed. When this might be is uncertain. The UK's chief scientific advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, said ""putting absolute timelines on things is not possible"".Doing this could, unintentionally, lead to herd immunity as more and more people were infected. But this could take years to build up, according to Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London: ""We're talking about suppressing transmission at a level whereby, hopefully, only a very small fraction of the country will be infected. ""So eventually, if we continued this for two-plus years, maybe a sufficient fraction of the country at that point might have been infected to give some degree of community protection.""But there is a question mark over whether this immunity will last. Other coronaviruses, which cause common cold symptoms, lead to a very weak immune response and people can catch the same bug multiple times in their lifetime. Alternatives - no clear endpoint""The third option is permanent changes in our behaviour that allow us to keep transmission rates low,"" Prof Woolhouse said.This could include keeping some of the measures that have been put in place. Or introducing rigorous testing and isolation of patients to try to stay on top of any outbreaks.""We did early detection and contact tracing the first time round and it didn't work,"" Prof Woolhouse adds.Developing drugs that can successfully treat a Covid-19 infection could aid the other strategies too.They could be used as soon as people show symptoms in a process called ""transmission control"" to stop them passing it onto others.Or to treat patients in hospital to make the disease less deadly and reduce pressures on intensive care. This would allow countries to cope with more cases before needing to reintroduce lockdowns.Increasing the number of intensive care beds would have a similar effect by increasing the capacity to cope with larger outbreaks. I asked the UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, what his exit strategy was. He told me: ""Long term, clearly a vaccine is one way out of this and we all hope that will happen as quickly as possible.""And that ""globally, science will come up with solutions"".Follow James on Twitter"
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52840763,Coronavirus: The mystery of asymptomatic 'silent spreaders',David Shukman,['31 May 2020'],"As the crisis has unfolded, scientists have discovered more evidence about a strange and worrying feature of the coronavirus. While many people who become infected develop a cough, fever and loss of taste and smell, others have no symptoms at all and never realise they're carrying Covid-19. Researchers say it's vital to understand how many are affected this way and whether ""silent spreaders"" are fuelling the pandemic.When people gathered at a church in Singapore on 19 January, no-one could have realised that the event would have global implications for the spread of coronavirus. It was a Sunday and, as usual, one of the services was being conducted in Mandarin. Among the congregation at The Life Church and Missions, on the ground floor of an office building, was a couple, both aged 56, who'd arrived that morning from China.As they took their seats, they seemed perfectly healthy so there was no reason to think they might be carrying the virus. At that time, a persistent cough was understood to be the most distinctive feature of Covid-19 and it was seen as the most likely way to transmit it. Having no symptoms of the disease should have meant having no chance of spreading it.  The couple left as soon as the service was over. But shortly afterwards, things took a turn for the worse, and in a wholly confusing way. The wife started to become ill on 22 January, followed by her husband two days later. Because they had flown in from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, that was no big surprise.But over the following week, three local people also came down with the disease for no obvious reason, leading to one of Singapore's first and most baffling coronavirus cases. Working out what had happened would lead to a new and disturbing insight into how the virus was so successfully finding new victims.Mobilising 'disease detectives'""We were extremely perplexed,"" says Dr Vernon Lee, head of communicable diseases at Singapore's Ministry of Health. ""People who didn't know one another somehow infected each other,"" while showing no sign of illness. This new batch of cases simply did not make sense, according to what was known about Covid-19 back then.So Dr Lee and his fellow scientists, along with police officers and specialist disease trackers, launched an investigation, generating detailed maps showing who was where and when. This involved the very best of the process known as contact tracing - a version of which is getting under way now in the UK. It's seen as a vital system for tracking down everyone involved in an outbreak and helping to stamp it out, and Singapore is renowned for the skill and speed with which this is carried out.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Early in the pandemic, Singapore was seen as a shining example of how to tackle the virus                Amazingly, within a few days, investigators had spoken to no fewer than 191 members of the church and had found out that 142 of them had been there that Sunday. They quickly established that two of the Singaporeans who became infected had been at the same service as the Chinese couple. ""They could have spoken to each other, greeted each other, during the usual activities of a church service,"" says Dr Lee.That was a useful start and would explain in theory how the infection could have been passed on, apart from one key factor. It did not answer the crucial question of how the virus could have been transmitted by the two Chinese people when at that stage they had shown no indication of having the disease.And on top of that was an even greater puzzle. It was confirmed that the third Singaporean to become infected, a 52-year-old woman, had not been at the same service as the others. Instead she had attended another event in the same church later that day, so how could she have picked up the virus?Evidence no-one expectedInvestigators resorted to going through the CCTV recordings made at the church that Sunday to search for clues. And they stumbled across something completely unexpected - the woman who'd attended the later service, after the Chinese couple had left, had sat in the seats they had used several hours earlier.Somehow, despite having no symptoms and not feeling ill, the Chinese husband and wife had managed to spread the virus. Maybe they'd had it on their hands and touched the seats, maybe their breath carried the infection and it landed on a surface, it's not clear, but the implications were huge.For Dr Lee, piecing everything together, there was only one possible explanation - that the virus was being passed by people who had it without even realising. This was a revelation that would be relevant the world over because the central message of all public health advice on coronavirus has always been to look out for symptoms in yourself and others.But if the virus was also being spread by people without symptoms, silently and invisibly, how could the disease be stopped? He remembers the moment, while working in his office, when the reality dawned on him. ""Every time you make a scientific discovery, it is like a 'eureka' moment when you realise that this is something important that you've uncovered, through the hard work of many individuals and teams.""Spread before symptoms showWhat was revealed was what's known as ""pre-symptomatic transmission"" where someone is unaware of being infected because the cough, fever and other classic symptoms have yet to begin. Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Singapore saw a rise in cases after appearing to have the virus under control                Along with many others, this study highlighted a critical period of 24-to-48 hours before the visible onset of the disease in which people can be highly infectious, perhaps even their most infectious.Being aware of that is potentially invaluable, because as soon as you realise you're ill then everyone you've been in close contact with can be warned to stay at home.That would mean that they would be isolating during the key phase of infection before their own symptoms start. But exactly how the disease can be transmitted without a cough to project droplets containing the virus is still open to debate.One option is that simply breathing or talking to someone can do the job. If the virus is reproducing in the upper respiratory tract at that time then it's possible that some of it will emerge with each exhalation. Anyone close enough, especially indoors, could easily pick it up.And another potential form of transmission is by touch - the virus gets onto someone's hands and they touch another person or a door handle - or a seat in a church. Whatever the route, the virus is clearly exploiting the fact that people are bound to be less vigilant if they're not aware that they might be infected.Some people never show symptoms This is an even more mysterious scenario, and one that scientists simply have no definitive answer to. It's one thing to know that people can be infectious before their symptoms show, quite another when they become infected but never have any sign of it.This is what's known as being ""asymptomatic"" because you are a carrier of the disease but do not suffer in any way yourself. The most famous case is that of an Irish woman who was working as a cook in New York at the beginning of the last century.Image copyrightGetty ImagesWherever Mary Mallon was employed, in house after house, people became ill with typhoid and at least three, maybe many more, died of it, but she was completely unaffected. Eventually a connection was established and it was confirmed that she was the unwitting spreader of the disease.Reporters dubbed her ""Typhoid Mary"", a label she always resented, but the authorities took no chances and kept her in confinement for 23 years until her death in 1938.Assumptions underminedStaff nurse Amelia Powell was shocked when she found out that she is asymptomatic. She was at work on her hospital ward at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in April when a doctor rang to give her the result of a swab test.She had been feeling normal and safe behind the personal protective equipment she had to wear while caring for patients with Covid-19. But suddenly all those assumptions were undermined because, to her horror, she had tested positive. ""It was a bit like hearing that someone in the family had passed, it was surreal. I thought, 'This can't be right, not me, I'm absolutely fine,'"" says 23-year-old Amelia. She had to leave her post straightaway to go into isolation at home.A SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?RISK AT WORK: How exposed is your job?HOW A VIRUS SPREADS: An explanationRECOVERY: How long does it take to get better?""I was worried because I've seen the other side, with patients deteriorating very quickly with it, so I did wonder if this would happen to me."" But, to her surprise, at no point did she feel unwell. ""I had nothing, literally - I was exercising indoors, eating normally, sleeping normally."" At the moment it's impossible to know how many cases of infection exist but remain hidden from view.The discovery that Amelia was infected was only revealed because she was part of a study of all the staff at her hospital. It produced the surprising result that as many as 3% of more than 1,000 people were positive while showing no symptoms at the time of the test.An even greater proportion of asymptomatic cases was found on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which had been sailing off the coast of Japan earlier this year. Later branded ""a petri dish for infection"", it had around 700 cases. Researchers found that three quarters of the people who had tested positive had no symptoms. And at a care home in Washington state more than half the residents were positive but had no sign of the illness.'No single reliable study'Different studies suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many cases are asymptomatic stretching from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects.The upshot, they said, was that ""there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics"". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, ""perhaps a lot of cases"".The risk of 'silent spreaders'The biggest concern of Amelia, the nurse, was that she might have unwittingly transmitted the virus either to those she works with or to the patients who depend on her help. ""I don't think I passed it on because all the colleagues I work with tested negative but it was worrying to think how long I'd been positive for,"" she says. ""But we still don't know if people who are asymptomatic are contagious or not - it's very bizarre and the information about it at the moment is minimal.""One study in China which found that the number of asymptomatic cases was actually greater than those with symptoms had a warning for the authorities. ""As 'silent spreaders',"" the scientists wrote, ""asymptomatic carriers warrant attention as part of disease prevention and control.""Image copyrightGetty ImagesThe team that studied that Diamond Princess reckoned that asymptomatic cases were likely to be less infectious than people with symptoms but even so they're estimated to have caused a significant number of cases. The 'dark matter' of asymptomatic infectionTo try to get an answer, scientists in Norwich are pushing for the population of the entire city to be tested.""Asymptomatic cases may be the 'dark matter' of the epidemic,"" according to Prof Neil Hall, head of the Earlham Institute, a life science research centre, who's leading the initiative. Dark matter is the invisible substance believed to make up most of the matter in the universe, and it's yet to be identified.Prof Hall worries that asymptomatic cases may actually be driving the pandemic, keeping it going despite public health measures. ""If you have people who don't know they're ill while using public transport and health care facilities, inevitably that's going to increase transmission,"" he says.""Any intervention that's only based on people coming to primary health care when they have symptoms will only deal with half the problem."" A team of scientists in California believes that not knowing who's carrying the virus without symptoms is the ""Achilles Heel"" of the fight against the pandemic.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    China launched a mass testing programme in Wuhan                In their view, the only way to stop the disease from spreading is to find out who's infected regardless of whether they think they are or not. That was also the recommendation of MPs on the Commons Science and Technology Committee in a letter to the Prime Minister Boris Johnson.They wrote that the risk of asymptomatic transmission has ""a profound consequence for the management of the pandemic"". And they said that anyone looking after vulnerable people - such as health workers or care workers - should be given regular testing.A similar approach is being adopted on a far larger scale in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic is thought to have begun.As many as 6.5 million people there were tested in as little as nine days in a mass screening programme designed to detect the disease - including in those showing no symptoms.Easing of lockdownAs lockdown measures are eased and more people start to use public transport, return to work or go shopping, getting to grips with the invisible risk matters more than ever. At the moment, there is no way of telling who among the growing crowds may be carrying the virus without knowing.That's why governments the world over say it's essential that everyone cooperates with efforts to trace the contacts of anyone infected and then quickly self-isolates. They also advise that the best defence remains social distancing - to keep apart wherever you can. But where that isn't possible, the recommendation is to cover your face, even with a mask that's homemade.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    More and more governments are advising wearing face masks                When the US government announced this policy, it highlighted the discoveries made in the church in Singapore back in January. The logic is that this is not about protecting yourself, it's about protecting others from you, in case you're infected but don't know it.Many health professionals worry that masks might distract people from hand washing or social distancing, or increase the risk of contamination if they're clumsily handled. But more and more governments, most recently that of the UK, have become convinced of the benefits. Not that face coverings will halt the pandemic on their own. But because there's still so little we know about asymptomatic transmission, almost anything is worth a try.You may also be interested in:When you talk to intensive care doctors across the UK, exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of Covid-19, one phrase emerges time after time: ""We've never seen anything like this before.""They knew a new disease was coming, and they were expecting resources to be stretched by an unknown respiratory infection which had first appeared in China at the end of last year.""It felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the D-Day landings,"" says Barbara Miles, clinical director of intensive care at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, ""with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing"".Read a summary, often in their own words, of what doctors have learnt about how Covid-19 attacks the human body."
https://www.bbc.com/news/53193835,Coronavirus: Why surviving the virus may be just the beginning,Chris Morris,['3 July 2020'],"The first thing Simon Farrell can remember, after being woken from a medically induced coma, is trying to tear off his oxygen mask.He had been in intensive care for 10 days, reliant on a ventilator just to breathe. ""I was trying to pull the mask off my face, and the nurse kept putting it back on,"" he recalls. When doctors woke him up, his body had fought off the worst of Covid-19 but he still needed oxygen to support his damaged lungs. And the 46-year-old father-of-two was suffering from such severe delirium he was trying to deny himself the oxygen he required.""Try to stop me,"" he remembers saying, when nurses at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital said they would have to put his hands in boxing glove-sized medical mittens unless he relaxed.""In the end they had to tape my hands up. I was trying to tear the mittens off, I managed to bite through them, and they had to put new mittens on.""It is not an unfamiliar story for anyone working in intensive care. The assault Covid-19 mounts on the most severely ill means patients are ventilated for longer, and require a deeper level of sedation, than the typical ICU patient.That has produced ""a lot of delirium, confusion and agitation"", explains Dr Kulwant Dhadwal, a consultant who runs the intensive care unit at London's Royal Free Hospital.""Usually if you have a surgical procedure, or normal pneumonia patients come to ICU, you wake them up and they're less confused and less disoriented than this.""""This particular group of patients were a lot more difficult to wean off the ventilator.""Even when that process is a success, it is only the beginning of a long process of physical and psychological recovery. And now the UK has moved past the peak of the virus, attention is turning to the huge challenge - both in the health service and in the community - of rehabilitating Covid-19 survivors.""Often rehabilitation is seen as a Cinderella service and not a priority,"" says Sally Singh, professor of pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation at the University of Leicester.""But because of Covid, and the number of people that it has affected, the need is pressing. It has become a national priority - to support people to get better.""A long roadTens of thousands of people around the UK are now setting out on that journey.Some came close to death in intensive care units, others needed less intrusive hospital treatment to help them through the worst. All of them have had their lives changed by Covid-19.But for the most seriously ill patients in intensive care, rehabilitation begins well before they are woken from a coma. Physical and psychological support has to be there from the start. Even when a patient is asleep, nurses and therapists will move their joints and their bodies to make sure they don't get too stiff.""For example, we have an in-bed bike,"" explains Kate Tantam, a specialist rehabilitation sister in intensive care at University Hospital Plymouth NHS Trust.""Even if a patient is on multiple organ support on a ventilator, and on lots of drugs to keep them alive, we will still put them on a bike.""""We bring it to the bed, and we can put their feet into it, and the machine can then do the work for you.""ICU staff will also talk constantly to patients while they are deeply sedated, telling them where they are, and what is happening to them, and reassuring them that they are safe. It's all part of the process of preparing them for the moment when they are woken up.   ""Some patients do wake up saying, 'I remember your voice,'"" says Kulwant Dhadwal. ""They wake up with some kind of memory.""Image copyrightGetty ImagesBut the process with Covid-19 has proved even more delicate and difficult than normal, partly because so many ICU patients were on mechanical ventilators for extraordinarily long periods of time.Many of them woke up profoundly weak, although some regained strength unexpectedly quickly.""Usually when somebody's been asleep for 40 days or more, it takes six weeks or longer for them to be totally free of the ventilator, to be ready to even start walking or standing,"" Kulwant Dhadwal says.""But some of these patients were making progress within a week, which we found very unusual, very specific to this disease.""Another challenge in the immediate recovery from critical illness with Covid-19 is the severe inflammation.Many patients can't cope with a breathing tube inserted through the mouth because the larynx and the area above the vocal cords are badly swollen as part of the illness. That means doctors have often had to often perform tracheostomies, creating an opening in the neck to gain access to the windpipe, in order to remove the breathing tube that connects patents to the ventilator.""You've got to look after the tracheostomy, it's a wound in the neck,"" explains Carl Waldmann, a consultant in intensive care at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading.""So, it was a long, slow process getting them off the ventilator. It might take them a week or two weeks or even longer."" ""I was nearly a goner""And behind every observation lies a human story.Abraham Raskin's family were told in late April that it was unlikely he would survive. But on 12 June he finally left the Royal London Hospital after more than 50 days in intensive care, a tracheostomy, and a month in a medically induced coma.""The very fact that I'm alive now is a miracle,"" he says, ""I was nearly a goner.""On a video call arranged by nurses on 18 May his family saw his face for the first time since he was taken into hospital in early April. He wasn't able to say anything, but he did raise an eyebrow.Abraham was severely delirious for some time after waking up. ""I was talking all kinds of rubbish,"" he says.""Afterwards when I heard about what I was saying, I felt like I was mad or something. It's not pleasant.""But he is now back at home, still very tired, and following a basic exercise programme planned from him by a physiotherapist. With support from family members, he can get upstairs to sleep at night.  ""Some people can't really walk anymore when they come out of this,"" he says, ""and some take months to recover. I hope I'm not one of them.""DeliriumAs many as three-quarters of intensive care patients who need mechanical ventilation to help them breathe will suffer from delirium. And the observations of many doctors suggest that delirium has been particularly acute, and hallucinations unusually vivid, for people who fall critically ill with Covid-19.Delirium can be caused by the infection itself, and the fevers which accompany it. But it is intensified by the strong sedative drugs that have to be used to keep patients comfortable, and the unsettling environment of intensive care they find themselves in.While patients are in a coma, and after they wake up and begin withdrawing from these drugs, they often experience frightening hallucinations, and cling to unsettling beliefs about what is going on.""Delirium doesn't have a dreamlike quality,"" says Dorothy Wade, the principal health psychologist in intensive care at University College Hospital in London. ""Patients always say 'it was completely real - I was just living in this terrifying alternative reality.'""Doctors think that chemical imbalances prompt the brain to create its own explanation for why the body can't move and the patient can't speak. Often people think they've been kidnapped or tortured, or they think they're in a prison cell about to be put on trial.""They tend to feel that the nurses and the doctors and the staff are all in some conspiracy,"" says Dorothy Wade, ""that this is all part of a conspiracy to make money out of them by selling their blood or their organs.""It means that psychologists like Dr Wade try to step in as early as possible. It's important not to argue with delirious patients, she says, but instead to try to offer reassurance about what has really been happening.Simon Farrell left hospital relatively quickly after being taken off a ventilator, but he still recalls the vivid nature of the delirium he experienced.""I remember Elliott, my younger son, coming into the room in PPE,"" he says. ""Now, that clearly wasn't right. No children were allowed on the ward. The hospital was locked down. It didn't happen.""In his head at the time, though, he believed it to be absolutely true.""You just feel it is what's happening,"" he says. ""And there was a lot worse than that. That was a simple one.""SCHOOLS: When will children be returning?EXERCISE: What are the guidelines on getting out?THE R NUMBER: What it means and why it mattersAIR TRAVELLERS: The new quarantine rulesLOOK-UP TOOL: How many cases in your area?FamilyThe challenge of dealing with the acute delirium that accompanies Covid-19 has been heightened by the fact that family members can't be at the bedside when patients are trying to return to reality. Seriously ill people wake into a world of flashing lights and machines, of disrupted sleep and hospital staff in full PPE.""It has a huge impact on patients,"" explains Krystyna Walton, a consultant in rehabilitation medicine at the Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester. ""They are already confused, and it must be incredibly difficult.""""If somebody has suffered encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and they have memory problems or insight problems, they're not aware of the way that Covid has affected the world, so they can't understand why there are no visitors.""And the social isolation imposed by the pandemic also has repercussions for friends and family.Hannah Farrell, Simon's wife, works as a neuro physiotherapist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where he was a patient. She recalls one evening when he was still severely delirious, a nurse she knew rang and suggested that hearing her voice on the phone might calm Simon down.""Apparently, it settled Simon, but it certainly didn't settle me,"" she says. ""I didn't sleep all night, because Simon just didn't sound like Simon at all.""""For me, it was quite upsetting, and I'm sure other relatives have said the same.""Long-term problemsSome patients can still be delirious weeks after waking up.And delirium, says Kate Tantam, along with other frightening early experiences, ""is the key link to post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression"" among people who survive their time in ICU.Roughly one in five people who pass through intensive care in normal times go on to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). And the signs are that with Covid patients that number could be considerably higher.The same goes for more general anxiety and depression after leaving hospital. The extreme circumstances of the Covid pandemic, and the social isolation that has come with it, are likely to make things worse. The lack of a reassuring family presence, for example, continues to pose additional problems after patients are released from acute hospital wards into care homes and rehabilitation units. Hospitals have invested in iPads to facilitate contact, and family liaison teams make sure video calls take place every day, but it's not quite the same.Image copyrightGetty ImagesKrystyna Walton gives the example of one of her patients who had severe Covid pneumonia, as well as renal failure and dialysis. The patient spent several weeks in critical care, and several more on a medical ward before being moved to a rehabilitation ward with cognitive deficits. They have not been able to see their family for three months.Normally in a rehabilitation unit, staff would try to personalise a patient's surroundings and encourage them to wear their own clothes. But the restrictions surrounding Covid have prevented much of that. And because family members are unable to visit, or speak to medical staff face-to-face, they often struggle to understand just how sick their relative has been.""There are no visitors in care homes, there are no visitors in rehabilitation in the NHS or in the independent sector,"" says Krystyna Walton.""And even after leaving rehab there have been restrictions that we all have had to deal with, which makes it more difficult to visit a vulnerable person in their own home. All of this has a huge psychological impact.""So, the NHS is going to have to prepare for the possibility of a fresh wave of PTSD patients, just as it is trying to deal with a backlog of mental health (and other) cases which have been neglected during the worst of the pandemic. ""We won't know for several months how big a problem this is going to be,"" says Dorothy Wade.""To begin with people are very relieved to be out of hospital, especially after such a long stay. Sometimes it can take quite a long time for them to realise that something still isn't quite right.""It doesn't always turn out that way. Alongside post-traumatic stress, doctors acknowledge the concept of post-traumatic growth, and point to patients who emerge from critical care with a new outlook on life.""There are some people who - no matter how difficult this has been - find themselves in a more positive frame of mind,"" explains Julie Highfield, a consultant clinical psychologist based in intensive care units in Cardiff.""People feel this is a chance they never thought they would have, and they are determined to live their life well.""Simon Farrell is certainly trying to focus on the positive and he has been recovering week by week. But he admits it has to be tinged with realism.""I think people feel if they get physically stronger, they're then mentally stronger and they're fine. And that's not always the case. The two are not aligned.""Physical recoveryFor many people physical recovery can provide the biggest challenge, particularly if they have spent weeks in intensive care.""Covid is a nasty, nasty disease that kicks every single system you've got in the neck,"" says Kate Tantam.And sometimes when people wake up from four weeks of sedation, like thousands of Covid-19 patients have done, the only thing they can move is their fingertips.""We have to rebuild everything with them,"" she says, ""and teach them how to do everything physically again - from being able to feed yourself or being able to touch your hair, to being able to stand and being able to sit.""A prolonged period of recovery is not unusual after intensive care, but many Covid-19 patients have experienced particularly severe fatigue and muscle wasting. They are exhausted - sitting in a chair for half an hour might be followed by four hours sleep. And rebuilding muscle takes time.Image copyrightGetty Images""If we don't give patients the right level of nutritional input, they are not going to recover,"" Kate Tantam says.So, dieticians have an important role to play, alongside physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.  If you have just survived a multi-system disease which attacks different parts of the body in different ways, it stands to reason that you need various forms of help to recover.Many Covid patients will return to normal life relatively quickly. But some have suffered kidney failure and may require ongoing renal support, while others will need to be referred to cardiologists or may have developed neurological conditions that require specialist care.The challenge, says Carl Waldmann, ""is to make sure that everyone gets what they need, and that the right support can be provided at the right time.""""I think the greatest burden will be in the community,"" argues Krystyna Walton, ""because many of these patients will have quite subtle deficits that will only become evident to them as they start recovering physically, weeks and months after going home.""Breathlessness The most common physical challenge for recovering Covid-19 patients is shortness of breath - and that can apply to people who had moderate as well as severe symptoms of the disease.""For patients that are coming out of hospital,"" says Sally Singh, ""clearly they're breathless because they've had a respiratory disease. Their lungs are temporarily damaged, but they are also deconditioned because they've been lying in a hospital bed for so long that they've become pretty unfit.""It means that simple things like going up and down stairs can become extremely challenging, especially in elderly patients.But breathlessness is an issue that goes well beyond survivors of intensive care. And a significant minority of people who've been infected with the coronavirus are still struggling to shake it off.""I'd crash in a heap""Jenny Goldblatt, an infectious diseases doctor at the Royal Free Hospital, fell ill with Covid-19 in March and it has lingered ever since - returning in waves of fatigue, chest pains and breathing difficulties.She spent a couple of days in hospital in March, where she was given a little extra oxygen. But it was only after going home that her problems began in earnest.""Every 10 days or so I'd start to feel a little better and I'd start to go for longer walks,"" she says. ""But then I'd crash in a heap and couldn't get out of bed for a week.""It was a month after falling ill that she first managed to walk to the end of the road and back. A keen cyclist, her next goal is to cycle around the block.""I can't imagine when I will be able to take my bike for a proper ride, and if I think about that too much it gets a bit depressing.""Jenny thinks she has cleared the virus, and she has ""easily detectable"" antibodies in her blood, but her body is continuing to react in unusual ways. Post-viral fatigue is not unique to Covid-19, but this is something more.Jenny has suffered chest pains and breathlessness; other patients with lingering symptoms report severe headaches or abdominal pains. Three months after falling ill, going back to work or resuming normal life is out of the question.""I am getting better slowly,"" she says, ""but I can't be too ambitious. It is frustrating to be on this rollercoaster, with absolutely no idea how long the journey will take.""ChallengesPrevious medical experience with pneumonia suggests it can take months, or in extreme cases years, for patients to get back to where they were before. With Covid-19, we are still early in the cycle of rehabilitation and recovery, and every patient is different.""The honest answer is we don't yet know how long it will take,"" says Sally Singh. ""People are researching that as we speak - monitoring chest x-rays, symptoms and the wellbeing of patients to help us identify what the best intervention to support these people may be.""The trouble is the provision of rehabilitation services across the country can be patchy, especially for people emerging from critical care. And the NHS is already dealing with a massive backlog of non-Covid cases that have been delayed.""The huge challenge,"" says Krystyna Walton, ""is going to be the increase in numbers.""At the peak of the outbreak the priority was to get patients out of acute hospital settings quickly to free up bed space. That means in many cases the rehabilitation assessments that would normally be done in hospital would have been done in the community, or in a care home or a non-specialist rehabilitation setting.Image copyrightGetty Images""And my suspicion,"" Krystyna Walton adds, ""is that many patients may have not had their needs assessed properly.""Carl Waldmann, who has been working on improving the rehabilitation of seriously ill patients for more than 25 years, says one of the best analogies he can think of is building a rocket, and training an astronaut. ""You put them up into space, but you also have to think about where they're going to land and what we're going to do when they get back.""It is the same, he says, if you put a patient through the complexities of intensive care.""We've had some patients who need seven specialists looking after them afterwards,"" he says, ""and unless they have all those bits of the jigsaw puzzle, there is a chance they won't make the recovery they could have made.""It is important to emphasise those rehabilitation needs don't stop after the immediate recovery period. Many patients will suffer from scarring of the lungs - a permanent and often debilitating condition. Doctors also know that a significant number of people who have been critically ill have suffered cognitive deficits. Ideally they should have screening for return to driving a vehicle, and for return to work. ""Rehabilitation has to sort of blur into real life and getting back out into the community,"" says Krystyna Walton, ""doing what you used to do before, looking after your family, earning an income, enjoying leisure facilities and exercise.""""And that is what takes time and expertise.""The NHS and individual hospitals are of course building rehabilitation into their Covid recovery plans, but this is a system that has been overlooked for years. Experts in the field hope, despite all the pressures, that Covid will provide a launch pad for change.""Hospitals are very good at treating people, doing something to somebody to make them better,"" says Kate Tantam. ""But what they are not always very good at is prioritising the therapeutic and rehabilitation input afterwards.""It is, in other words, not just about survival, it is about health-related quality of life.""There is no point giving somebody a massive intensive care stay, if you don't try to return them to where they want to be.""Additional reporting: Oliver BarnesIllustrations: Emma LynchYou may also be interested in:When you talk to intensive care doctors across the UK, exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of Covid-19, one phrase emerges time after time: ""We've never seen anything like this before.""They knew a new disease was coming, and they were expecting resources to be stretched by an unknown respiratory infection which had first appeared in China at the end of last year.And as the number of cases increased, doctors up and down the UK were reading first-hand accounts from colleagues in China, and then in Italy - in scientific journals and on social media - about the intensity of infection.""It felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the D-Day landings,"" says Barbara Miles, clinical director of intensive care at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, ""with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing"".But what arrived in the UK as winter turned into spring took even the most experienced ICU specialists by surprise.

It might be infrared temperature checks in the lobby, contactless lifts, or new apps to spread workers out and keep shared surfaces clean, but there's no doubt the post-coronavirus office is getting a drastic technological refit.More Technology of BusinessFinding the 'invisible' millions who are not on mapsHow much does your boss know about you?When working from home is much more than emailingCreating an online course 'changed my life'The hidden detectors looking for knives and gunsIt could all start as soon as you wake up in the morning. You may check your building app, says David Garten, vice president at RXR Realty which owns and manages 93 properties in the New York area. The firm's new app creates a building health index each day, from information like air quality, the number of occupants, and how well social distancing is being observed.  If your building has a low rating that day, you might decide to work from home, or go to a smaller satellite office instead.The app will also tell you the ideal time to arrive, to reduce congestion, and people riding public transport at peak times. ""So the ideal time for me to walk through our lobby is 10am,"" says Mr Garten.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Fever screening is a common sight                Then on entering, you may pass through an infrared fever-screening system, says James Lawrence of Gensler, a large design and architecture firm based in San Francisco. FLIR Systems, one Oregon company that makes these crowd thermal cameras, has seen its demand increase 700%.If a concierge judges you high risk from the infrared screening, they might double-check your temperature with a handheld device. Then, you might need to have your meeting by video conference from a quarantine room, or take a car home or to hospital.If you make it through the lobby, then perhaps you will operate the lift with buttons on your app. Once upstairs, it will tell you when your workstation was last cleaned, Mr Garten says.When it gets to lunchtime, you'll order food by an app, says John Robson, asset director at Workspace, which has 69 office properties around London focusing mainly on small companies.Image copyrightWorkspaceImage caption                    Workers will probably have to spread out more                ""Every transaction is cashless now, and your food will basically be grab and go,"" he says.If you pop to the loo after lunch, you'll be increasingly looking at touchless taps, Mr Lawrence says.New software is helping companies spread people out.Gensler's tool ReRun imports floor plans, calculates safe bubbles around each worker, and then outputs different ways to place workers so their bubbles do not overlap.""Recently we did an analysis on a two million square-foot building that took roughly 10 days to turn around. Otherwise it would've taken several weeks,"" says Mr Lawrence.For the same reason, some companies are looking to teach artificial intelligence (AI) to video cameras.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Artificial intelligence can look for office ""pinch points""                AI algorithms can offer feedback about ""pinch points"" where people are too close together, while protecting individual privacy, says Dr Mahesh Saptharishi, Motorola Solutions' chief technology officer, based in Boston.Instead of watching the actual video, they can ask the AI how well social distancing is being observed overall, and where problem points are. ""So employees don't feel someone's watching what they do,"" he says.Meanwhile, your cleaner might well be employee of the month for many months to come.An April study in The Lancet Microbe showed the virus can last on plastic and stainless steel (like door handles) for up to seven days, and glass (like screens) for four days.Cleaning wipes can disrupt the layer of fat that surrounds and protects coronavirus. And bleach's active ingredient sodium hypochlorite destroys the crown of protein spikes that gives the virus its name, and the ribonucleic acid (RNA) which is its blueprint to reproduce. So does the ethanol in surgical spirits.But it would be helpful to know which surfaces should be cleaned.Contact tracing needs to keep track of the surfaces and facilities you and sick colleagues used, says Matt Calkins, head of US software development platform Appian, which has also made coronavirus workplace safety software.If you know which of your rooms to target, you know where best to send your deep cleaning team, and maximise use of your bleach, ethanol and wipes, Mr Calkins says.The virus can also be carried in the air, on water droplets or fine dust particles, say researchers. So what about air conditioning systems?Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Office owners will be working hard to make their buildings attractive                The UK government says the risk of air conditioning spreading coronavirus in the workplace is ""extremely low"".Nevertheless, ""we're advising organisations to look at their air conditioning system,"" says Dr Mark Parrish, Northern European medical director from International SOS, which advises companies about medical risks.Filters with extremely narrow openings - like high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and the more powerful ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) ones - can remove coronavirus from circulating in the air, according to UK air filter manufacturer SPCB.The problem is such ventilation systems will normally need stronger fans to push air through these narrower filters, it says.Upgrading air conditioning could be one of many options used by office owners to keep their tenants happy.Maciej Markowski of spaceOS says simple convenience might be the winning factor.""It's ridiculous that you're in a building and it's easier to order food from across town than the restaurant downstairs. Or with three taps on your phone you can tell Amazon a package is broken, but there's no way to tell your building there's a huge spill in front of your office."""

In an industrial park in Jiangsu near China's east coast it makes the rails and the racks for the shops that some of you go to. Or at least it used to.Two floors of manufacturing, around 100 employees, have been reduced to only a handful of staff turning up every day.Most of the machines are now switched off, cardboard boxes stacked up, piles of rusty inventory on the floor.How bad are China's economic woes?China's virus-hit economy shrinks for first time in decadesHuang Xuefeng is not very busy.

But they are particularly vulnerable in this crisis.In recent years the government and the Communist Party has been more focused on consolidating and protecting state-owned enterprises: the industrial, transport, telecoms and financial giants that they own.Add to this small companies' over-reliance on doing business in the US - it only has American customers - and it is clear that Lotus is very, very vulnerable. One hundred jobs are on the line.Employment of 'paramount importance'An impending unemployment crisis is the stuff of nightmares for China's leaders. The ruling Communist Party worries incessantly about the effects on social stability.Small but visible protests sprang up in Wuhan in April. Workers in a shopping centre gathered to demonstrate against rents they could no longer afford.The official jobless total in China's cities has already hit the government's target.

Employment is the biggest concern in people's lives. It is something of paramount importance for all families.""Addressing workers at firms like Lotus, Mr Li said: ""Many export companies have no orders now, which has greatly affected their employees.""We must provide support to all these people and businesses in difficulties, but most importantly, we must help them land jobs.""But there is one group the party is particularly worried about: graduates.Under pressureThere are almost nine million graduates entering China's job market this summer.There are fewer jobs to go round.

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53305721,What is bubonic plague?,Michelle Roberts,['6 July 2020'],"Image copyrightGetty ImagesA suspected case of bubonic plague has been reported to Chinese authorities. It is not known how the patient became infected, but the country is on alert for more cases.Plague is one of the deadliest diseases in human history - but it can now be easily treated with antibiotics.What is bubonic plague?Plague is a potentially lethal infectious disease that is caused by bacteria called Yersinia pestis that live in some animals - mainly rodents - and their fleas. Bubonic plague is the most common form of the disease that people can get. The name comes from the symptoms it causes - painful, swollen lymph nodes or 'buboes' in the groin or armpit. From 2010 to 2015 there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths.Historically, it has also been called the Black Death, in reference to the gangrenous blackening and death of body parts, such as the fingers and toes, that can happen with the illness. What does it do?A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague between two and six days after being infected. Along with the tender, enlarged lymph nodes, that can be as large as a chicken egg, other symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and tiredness. Plague can also affect the lungs, causing a cough, chest pain and difficulty breathing. The bacteria can also enter the bloodstream and cause a condition called septicaemia or sepsis, which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure and death. How can you catch it? People can catch it from:Bites of infected fleasTouching infected animals such as rats and miceInhaling infected respiratory droplets spread by infected people or animalsDomestic cats and dogs can become infected from flea bites or from eating infected rodents. The infection could also enter the body through a cut in the skin if the person came in close contact with an infected animal's blood.The current alert in China forbids the hunting and eating of animals that could carry plague. The body of someone who has died after being infected with plague can infect people who are in close contact, such as those who are preparing the body for burial. Is there a treatment or a cure for it?Prompt treatment with antibiotics is vital. The disease is often lethal if left. Early diagnosis, using laboratory tests on blood and other body samples, can save lives. Could there be a new outbreak or pandemic?Plague still exists in many parts of the world. In recent years there have been outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Madagascar. Although plague has been the cause of widespread disease outbreaks in medieval times, any outbreaks today are thankfully small.Dr Matthew Dryden, consultant microbiologist at the University of Southampton in the UK, said: ""It is good that this has been picked up and reported at an early stage because it can be isolated, treated and spread prevented. ""Bubonic plague is caused by a bacterium and so, unlike Covid-19, is readily treated with antibiotics. So although this might appear alarming, being another major infectious disease emerging from the East, it appears to be a single suspected case which can be readily treated."""

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53181555,Coronavirus: How fast is it spreading in Africa?,Peter Mwai,['7 July 2020'],"Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Nigeria has been one of the worst-affected countries                Africa is seeing coronavirus cases rapidly increasing and deaths rising, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).We've looked at the situation across the continent, and examined which countries are of most concern.How fast is coronavirus spreading?In terms of overall numbers, Africa currently accounts for only a small proportion of total global cases, but the acceleration in rates of infection in some countries is clearly a cause for concern.While it took nearly 100 days for Africa to reach an initial 100,000 cases, it took only 18 days for that to double to 200,000. It doubled again to 400,000 cases over the next 20 days.The upward trend in Africa is starting to resemble other parts of the world that have been badly hit by the coronavirus. Most African countries are now experiencing community transmission, according to the WHO.This is when a person gets Covid-19 without having been in contact with a known case from abroad or a confirmed domestic case, which makes it hard for for the authorities to track down the source of a local outbreak.Where are Africa's hotspots?The two countries with the highest numbers of cases are South Africa and Egypt. They accounted for over 60% of all the new cases reported in late June.South Africa has the highest recorded number of total cases, while Egypt has the largest number of recorded coronavirus deaths.South Africa, which imposed one of the world's strictest lockdowns in late March, has seen cases rise steadily after this was relaxed in early May.The Western Cape province (where Cape Town is located), accounts for nearly half of all cases in the country and more than half of the deaths. But cases are steadily rising in Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg.Egypt has seen case numbers rising rapidly since mid-May, but there are indications that this may now have reached a peak with recorded new infections levelling off slightly in early July.There is also concern about what is happening in Nigeria, which recorded the second-highest increase in deaths from Covid-19 after South Africa in the WHO report for 1 July.                    mapped                Confirmed cases around the worldZoom toThe worldAfricaNorth AmericaLatin America & CaribbeanAsiaEuropeMiddle

steep increase in cases, and has been among those recording the highest increases in recent weeks.It's worth stressing that parts of the continent have seen relatively few cases, such as some areas of East Africa.In fact, the latest WHO Africa region report said just 10 countries accounted for more than 80% of all the reported cases on the continent.How many people are dying in Africa?The overall death rate has been low compared to the global average, despite the fact that many countries have poor health infrastructure.data in detail                            Scroll table to see more data

Due to revisions in the number of cases, an average cannot be calculated for this date.                                                    Source: Johns Hopkins University, national public health agencies and UN population data                                                    Figures last updated: 6 July 2020, 09:44 BST                        The WHO says this could be partly because of the relatively young population in Africa -  more than 60% under the age of 25. Current analysis suggests a lower mortality rate in younger people. But there are still five countries with death rates that are comparable to or higher than the most recent global average rate of 5% deaths from confirmed cases: Chad (8.5%)Algeria (6.6%)Niger (6.2%)Burkina Faso (5.5%)Mali (5.3)Githinji Gitahi, the head of Amref Health Africa, an NGO which specialises in health matters, says the higher rates could be an indication of much higher infection levels than those being recorded, but it could also be as a result of relatively low levels of testing. The fewer tests you carry out, the fewer confirmed cases you find, and so the number of deaths appears relatively high.The WHO says using community surveillance, where community health workers and other frontline staff report Covid-19 deaths, could be behind the high death rate reported, for example, in Chad.How much testing is done in Africa?Ten countries account for about 80% of the total tests conducted - South Africa, Morocco, Ghana, Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda, Mauritius, Kenya, Nigeria and Rwanda.There are wide variations in testing rates, with South Africa doing the most and Nigeria doing relatively few, according to Our World in Data, a UK-based project which collates Covid-19 information.On 4 July, South Africa was doing just over 30 tests per 1,000 people, compared with 72 in the UK and 105 in the US. Nigeria is achieving 0.7 tests per 1,000 people, Ghana 10 and Kenya 3.It's worth pointing out that for some African countries, it is impossible to know what exactly is happening due to a lack of any data or data being incomplete.""We have to take the numbers with a pinch of salt,"" says Chiedo Nwankwor, a lecturer in African affairs at Johns Hopkins University in the US.In Tanzania, President John Magufuli has voiced doubts about the validity of virus testing results at the national laboratory, and has allowed only limited data on infection rates and testing to be made public. Equatorial Guinea had a row with the WHO after accusing its country representative of inflating the number of Covid-19 cases.  For a while it held back its data, but has now started sharing it again.And in Kano state in northern Nigeria, an unusual spike of close to 1,000 deaths was reported in late April, but the government has not still confirmed how many were due to Covid-19.Note: The graphics in this page use a different source for figures for France from that used by Johns Hopkins University, which results in a slightly lower overall total.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53305940,Iran blasts: What is behind mysterious 'attacks' at key sites?,Jiyar Gol,['6 July 2020'],"Image copyrightReutersImage caption                    The fire at Natanz is reported to have set back Iran's nuclear programme                Just after midnight on 30 June, an email dropped into my inbox. It claimed to be from an unknown group calling itself the Homeland Cheetahs.The group said it had attacked the major Iranian nuclear site at Natanz some two hours earlier, at 02:00 local time. In the detailed message, it claimed it had blown up a facility and that the Iranian regime would not be able to hide it.The group said it was composed of dissidents within Iran's military and security forces and that they had been behind numerous attacks that the Iranian authorities had so far concealed from the public.I went online to check Iranian news agencies and reliable accounts on social media, but I found no mention of such an attack anywhere.Several hours later, Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation announced there had been an incident at the Natanz nuclear plant, but they ruled out sabotage. Interactive                Incident at Natanz nuclear site                        3 July                        1 July            The next day, Iran's Supreme National Security Council - its top security body - announced that it knew what caused the ""incident"" at Natanz but that ""for security reasons"" it would not for the time being say what this was.Nasa satellite images showed there had been a fire at Natanz at 02:06. The damage corresponded with details contained in the email from the Homeland Cheetahs.The group's message had been carefully crafted and included a propaganda video about attacks on strategic sites it said it had carried out inside Iran. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 wordsWhy do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter?Iranians on Trump and the nuclear dealPreparing this kind of statement and video requires hours, if not days, of planning. Whoever authored it knew about the Natanz explosion in advance, which supports the theory that it was an act of sabotage. But there is also the possibility that the email was an elaborate attempt to mislead us as to who was behind the attack, and could actually be the work of foreign agents posing as opponents of the regime in Iran.Attack 'thwarted'The group's name, the Homeland Cheetahs, is similar to those of other ""Iranian"" cyber groups, such as Persian Cat,  or Charming Kitten - teams of hackers believed to be part of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Cyber Army. It is possible that the Homeland Cheetahs were born to confront the Persian Cat. Image caption                    Israel says it foiled an attempt to sabotage its water system                In late May, national cyber security in Israel - Iran's arch-foe - said the country had prevented a major cyber attack on its water system, widely thought to have been the work of Iran.Days later, there was a cyber attack on Shahid Rajaae, an important economic and shipping hub in southern Iran.More than 50% of Iran's sea imports and exports take place through this harbour. The attack caused a massive blockage of water in the canals and flooded roads leading to the terminal. Iranian officials blamed power shortages, but Western intelligence sources believe it was Israeli retaliation against Iran.Fires and blastsIn the past three months there have been an increasing number of mysterious incidents which have damaged sensitive sites in Iran.Numerous fires have broken out in nuclear facilities, oil refineries, power plants, major factories and businesses across the country.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53244843,Coronavirus: Disease detectives track an invisible culprit,Tara McKelvey,['6 July 2020'],"Image copyrightGetty ImagesDisease detectives are trying desperately to beat the clock and find those who have been exposed to the virus. Can they move fast enough to stop the pandemic? As a public-health director in Savannah, Georgia, Cristina Pasa Gibson spent her time in an office filled with calorie counters and yoga mats and the scent of jasmine tea. Then she started working on contact tracing, a no-holds-barred effort to stop the pandemic, and her office and her life were turned upside down. ""I felt like I was in a Vegas casino,"" she says. ""I didn't know what time it was, what day it was, who I was.""She and her colleagues in Savannah and her counterparts in other cities across the country have been working frantically to trace the path of the infection and to find those who may have been exposed to the virus. They talk to patients, asking for names of individuals they have spent time with, and chase down those individuals and to tell them to remain isolated so they do not infect others. The pressure on investigators and contact tracers has been intense. ""I basically lived in my office,"" says Gibson, describing the early days. ""It was Groundhog Day over and over.""  Today their role is even more important. The US now has the highest number of cases and deaths in the world. Red State, Blue StateGibson is grappling with the pandemic, and she and her colleagues are trying to use contact tracing as a way to contain the virus. Her counterparts in New Haven, Connecticut, a city that lies almost 900 miles to the north, are also working feverishly to track the disease. Yale University student Tyler Shelby, 26, the son of a Kansas police detective and a fan of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes (played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a BBC version), helped to organise an investigative squad and coordinates dozens of volunteers.Image copyrightCourtesy of ShelbyImage caption                    Tyler Shelby, shown above at the Connecticut shore, helped put together a contact-tracing team                Cristina Pasa Gibson of Savannah and Tyler Shelby of New Haven are struggling with life-or-death matters in a country where people are deeply divided in their views of the pandemic and how the government should manage the health crisis. The number of cases has shot up in Georgia, Florida, Texas and other states where governors tried to reinforce Trump's message about the nation's economic comeback. Meanwhile the number of cases in Connecticut, New York and other northern states, places initially hit hard by the virus, has gone down.The contact-tracing initiatives in New Haven and Savannah are far from perfect. But they have been recognised by experts in the field as programmes that were started early and run with vigour. Taken together, these two programmes offer a snapshot of the high-stakes drama of contact tracing and show how the system is being put in place in both the northern and the southern parts of the country. Uncovering secret livesGibson spoke recently on the phone in her Savannah office with someone who had tested positive: ""He asked me: 'Am I going to die?' That's a terrible question to be faced with because so much is unknown. I could not give that person a definite answer."" Talking to people on the phone when they are scared and anxious is hard. In addition, the people who work in contact tracing have to find out key information from those who have gotten sick.Image caption                    Cristina Pasa Gibson, shown at her parents' house in Gainesville, Virginia, beats drumsticks in a workout class to reduce pandemic stress                Investigators and contact tracers try to find out whom the patients spoke to during a two-day period before they became ill and for the period of time beyond that - until they isolated themselves from others. That means recalling anyone they saw for more than 15 minutes and who stood or sat within six feet of them. Did you see a movie, take an Uber or go to church? If so - did you stop for donuts? an investigator may ask, according to a government report on contact-tracing programmes. The challenges are immense: ""You're asking people to think back,"" says Yale student Tyler Shelby. This raises the possibility for potentially awkward conversations: ""You don't necessarily need to specify who they slept with. It's really just anybody that meets that criteria"", or the guidelines that define close contact as anyone within six feet of you.What's behind alarming new US outbreaks? Is the pandemic getting worse in the US?The conversations with a patient on the phone can be tough, with long silences. ""Definitely people can have hesitation,"" Shelby says.  ""My first call - I was really nervous,"" says Yale student Paulina Luna Martinez, who is 27. She soon found it easy to speak with the people, though, and spends about a half-hour with each: ""They talk about their lives.""  She and the other volunteers send back the lists of contacts they have compiled, and a separate group of people tracks down the individuals on these lists, men and women who have been exposed to the virus. One of the most important aspects of contact tracing is helping those who are struggling. People who test positive need to stay separated from others, but they may need help. Those who have been exposed to the virus but remain healthy may not have enough money to see them through two weeks of isolation. As Columbia University's Patrick Kachur, explains, offering help to those who are sick and trying to protect others from the virus is one of the most important aspects of contact tracing. ""People think: 'This has to work because this is a key to getting back our lives,"" he says. ""But it's more than just counting cases and closing investigations. It's putting people in touch with the services they need."" Image copyrightCourtesy of familyImage caption                    ""My first call - I was really nervous."" says Paulina Luna Martinez, shown above on the left, with housemate Elsie Gonzalez in New Haven                In New Haven and Savannah, the investigators and contact tracers help people contact officials with social-service agencies if they need a place to stay during quarantine or would like someone to deliver groceries. In Nevada, says Adriane Casalotti, a spokeswoman for the National Association of County and City Health Officials, they feed their horses.Running against the clockContact tracing has a long history - the system was used to stop the spread of syphilis in the US in the 1930s. More recently, tracers ferreted out cases of Ebola in West Africa and other countries and helped beat back the disease. Yet contact tracing has never been used on a virus as ferocious as Covid-19, on such a broad scale, and these factors have helped to expose shortcomings in the tracing system. In England, the inefficiencies of the NHS Test and Trace, as the contact tracing programme is known, have been exposed by the BBC and other media.What went wrong with the coronavirus app?Analysts at the Center for Health Security say that the cost of the contact tracing, if done properly across the nation, would be steep: $3.6b USD.  Yet only some of the resources are available. According to NPR, about 37,000 tracers have so far been assigned to the taskNew Haven and Savannah are both about the same size. New Haven has a population of about 130,000, and Savannah has a population of 145,000. But Cristina Pasa Gibson and Tyler Shelby and others who live in these two cities have experienced the pandemic in different ways. Image copyrightCourtesy of Mark AbrahamImage caption                    DataHaven's Mark Abraham, right, with his son in New Haven during a stay-at-home order, maps areas where the virus has struck                New Haven, a city once known for its manufacturing industry and now for its university, Yale, is close to the New York epicentre. For many New Yorkers, New Haven is the end of the line, the place where they step off the train. In April, New Haven officials were reporting 20-35 new cases each week per 10,000 people, according to DataHaven, a nonprofit organisation, a spike that was caused partly by people from New York. By late June, more than 1,070 people had died of the disease in New Haven and the surrounding county.Savannah is a port city far from the coronavirus hotspots. In April, while Cristina Pasa Gibson and her colleagues were organising their team, they had fewer cases to manage. Officials in Savannah and the surrounding Chatham County reported only one or two new cases each week per 10,000 people, according to DataHaven. By late June, 37 people in Chatham County had died.  The number of cases in New Haven started to drop in the springtime. Slowly, though, cases in Savannah and Chatham County began to climb. The explanation for the disparity in infection rates between New Haven and Savannah are varied and complex. Geography plays a role, but so do decisions made by political leaders. The Republican governor of Georgia and the leaders of other states in the southern part of the country rushed to restart their economies. The Democratic governor of Connecticut and leaders of other northern states waited.  New Haven embodies the northern model - investigators and tracers were quickly deployed in large numbers (more than 150 were put in rotation, and they have since merged with a statewide group of several hundred). Savannah reflects the southern model of contact tracing and review of cases: their 49-member team is leaner. Image copyrightReutersImage caption                    Activists in Texas protest against contact tracing programmes                Albert Ko, a professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health who serves on a state board, the Reopen Connecticut Advisory Group, says the New Haven team is doing an above-average job. Experts have also praised the efforts in Savannah. In both cities, though, investigators are struggling to contact people fast enough. They are floundering in other ways too. The Savannah team members often find themselves without a Spanish speaker and rely on a Spanish-language phone line. In New Haven, they only managed to conduct interviews with 64% of the individuals they tried to contact, according to an epidemiologist with the New Haven health department.  Investigators and tracers should be able to contact 90% of patients within a day of hearing that they have the virus, according to the industry standard. Still, says Patrick Kachur, a Columbia University professor who used to work for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a programme like the one in New Haven has value. ""It's two-thirds of the way to 90%,"" Kachur says. ""Even if it can't be done perfectly, it's still worth doing."" Looking for cluesLast winter Tyler Shelby, who is studying for both a Yale medical degree and a public-health doctorate, was working at a cubicle decorated with potted vines and getting ready to go to Uganda on a Fulbright scholarship. Then he started seeing news about Covid-19 on Reddit. ""I thought: I'm needed right here,"" he says. He began working with his colleagues on a contact-tracing programme. Soon the number of cases shot up.Image copyrightReutersImage caption                    Public-health experts say 180,000 more people are needed for contact tracing, and US national guard members are being trained                Shelby and others on his team dug in and became specialists in US-based ""shoe-leather epidemiology"", as a Vermont health official, Daniel Daltry, puts it. Their heroes are amateur sleuths on true-crime podcasts and legendary figures such as Watson, the sidekick to the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. Watson could always ""go with the flow"", says Shelby: ""He puts up with Holmes, but he's observant himself.""The disease detectives are a diverse lot: working with Shelby, Yale medical student Paulina Luna Martinez began calling patients from her group house in New Haven. Maritza Bond, the city's public-health director, studied a heat map of her old neighbourhood, Fair Haven, an area filled with Puerto Rican families that became a Covid hot spot, and epidemiologist Brian Weeks tracked data (""I like to make sense of things,"" he says). Savannah epidemiologist Meredith Avery started working in a small-town pharmacy at 16, and Cristina Pasa Gibson used to take care of laboratory monkeys. The successes or failures of the disease detectives in the two cities hold lessons for those around the world.During her morning commute from Statesboro, a town that is about an hour's drive from Savannah, Avery listens to Crime Junkie. She has a keen interest in investigations, both criminal and epidemiological, and says that she felt uneasy in the early days of the pandemic and a bit excited too. ""You learn about these things in school,"" says 30-year-old Avery. ""And you think it's never going to happen here."" Contact tracers in Singapore used CCTV footage to track down people who were exposed to the virus. South Korean authorities constructed ""virtual nets"" around individuals to protect others from the virus, according to the Hill.How Singapore stayed one step ahead of the virusBut most people in the US baulk at contact-tracing apps, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, because of privacy concerns. Thurmond Neill Tillman, a pastor at First African Baptist Church in Savannah, says he understands the need for contact tracing: three people in his congregation have become ill with the virus. But he is concerned about the system's invasive nature. ""I can see how it would be very troubling,"" he says. ""I probably would have hated it as a teenager.""Image copyrightCourtesy of First African Baptist ChurchImage caption                    Pastor Thurmond Neill Tillman supports contact tracing but says the system raises privacy issues                Empathy lessonsDetectives are good listeners. They try to win the trust of people, and the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes is helpful. Cristina Pasa Gibson, 50, says she learned about cultural differences as a five-year-old while visiting her cousin in Manila. They came across an illustration of an egg basket in a colouring book, and her cousin painted one of the eggs dark, making it look like an egg soaked in slaked lime, a snack in the Philippines. ""I said: 'There's no such thing as a purple egg,' and I hit her,"" Gibson says. ""I was such a spoiled brat. That began my introspective journey."" Outside of Manila, Gibson saw families living in poverty, with ramshackle huts as homes, and decided in college to work in public health. The experience she had as a child have helped her in her work fighting the pandemic: she understands that not everyone sees the world in the same way, and they are fighting the virus in different ways too.A SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?UPLIFTING STORY: '' I got a life-changing opportunity in lockdown'MEETING FRIENDS: How can I do that safely?GLOBAL TAKE:  Which country has the most generous bailout?THE LOST SIX WEEKS: Missed chances for US to contain outbreakDisease detectives are now settling into their roles.

These mass gatherings pose problems for investigators and contact tracers, who struggle to get in touch with people who have joined the gatherings and may be infected. The people who are working on the contact-tracing programmes are honest about their limitations. ""From the beginning one of our mantras was: 'We'll do as much as we can for as long as we can,'"" says Yale student Tyler Shelby: ""Everything was unclear and nobody knew what was around the corner. We just accepted that uncertainty. We figured that we're not going to be able to resolve everything, but we're going to do what we can.""In Savannah, Cristina Pasa Gibson has been calling people to tell them about their Covid-19 test results, a departure from the traditional purview of contact tracing but part of the larger fight against the pandemic. She jokes with her colleagues about setting up metal bells in the office so they can ding them whenever someone on the phone calls out: ""Thank you, Jesus."" The person on the phone has escaped the virus, marking a victory for them and for the disease detectives too, and she wants to mark the occasion. "
https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51214864,Coronavirus: What it does to the body,James Gallagher,['14 March 2020'],"Image copyrightGetty Images The coronavirus emerged in only December last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - Covid-19.For most, the disease is mild, but some people die. So how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated?Incubation periodThis is when the virus is establishing itself.Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them.The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face.It first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into ""coronavirus factories"" that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells. At this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms. The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionEverything you need to know about the coronavirus – explained in one minute by the BBC's Laura FosterMild diseaseThis is all most people will experience. Covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough. Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed.The fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. It has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines.These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever.The coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus. Some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. You won't need specialist hospital care.  This stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus.However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19.This is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too.EASY STEPS: How to keep safeA SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?WHO'S AT RISK: Are women and children less affected?CONTAINMENT: What it means to self-isolateMAPS AND CHARTS: Visual guide to the outbreakVIDEO: The 20-second hand washSevere diseaseIf the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus. Those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. Too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body. ""The virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know,"" said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London.Image copyrightSPLImage caption                    Scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia                Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia. If it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs.This is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe. This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China.Critical diseaseIt is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill.By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death. The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body. It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely. Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive.  It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines.""The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania said.And if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage. Treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ECMO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in.But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive. The first deathsDoctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts.The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs. The first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital.He was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating.He died 11 days after he was admitted.The second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome.He was attached to an ECMO machine but this wasn't enough. He died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed.Follow James on Twitter."
https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51963486,Coronavirus: When will the outbreak end and life get back to normal?,James Gallagher,['23 March 2020'],"Image copyrightGetty ImagesThe world is shutting down. Places that were once teeming with the hustle and bustle of daily life have become ghost-towns with massive restrictions put on our lives - from lockdowns and school closures to travel restrictions and bans on mass gatherings.It is an unparalleled global response to a disease. But when will it end and when will we be able to get on with our lives?Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he believes the UK can ""turn the tide"" against the outbreak within the next 12 weeks and the country can ""send coronavirus packing"".But even if the number of cases starts to fall in the next three months, then we will still be far from the end.It can take a long time for the tide to go out - possibly years.It is clear the current strategy of shutting down large parts of society is not sustainable in the long-term. The social and economic damage would be catastrophic.What countries need is an ""exit strategy"" - a way of lifting the restrictions and getting back to normal.But the coronavirus is not going to disappear. If you lift the restrictions that are holding the virus back, then cases will inevitably soar. ""We do have a big problem in what the exit strategy is and how we get out of this,"" says Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh.""It's not just the UK, no country has an exit strategy.""It is a massive scientific and societal challenge.A SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?NEW GUIDANCE: What must I do?NEW RESTRICTIONS: What are they?LOOK-UP TOOL: Check cases in your areaMAPS AND CHARTS: Visual guide to the outbreakThere are essentially three ways out of this mess.vaccinationenough people develop immunity through infectionor permanently change our behaviour/society Each of these routes would reduce the ability of the virus to spread. Vaccines - at least 12-18 months awayA vaccine should give someone immunity so they do not become sick if they are exposed. Immunise enough people, about 60% of the population, and the virus cannot cause outbreaks - the concept known as herd immunity.The first person was given an experimental vaccine in the US this week after researchers were allowed to skip the usual rules of performing animal tests first.Vaccine research is taking place at unprecedented speed, but there is no guarantee it will be successful and will require immunisation on a global scale. The best guess is a vaccine could still be 12 to 18-months away if everything goes smoothly. That is a long time to wait when facing unprecedented social restrictions during peacetime. ""Waiting for a vaccine should not be honoured with the name 'strategy', that is not a strategy,"" Prof Woolhouse told the BBC.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    A cough is one of the symptoms of Covid-19                Natural immunity - at least two years awayThe UK's short-term strategy is to drive down cases as much as possible to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed - when you run out of intensive care beds then deaths spike.Once cases are suppressed, it may allow some measures to be lifted for a while - until cases rise and another round of restrictions are needed. When this might be is uncertain. The UK's chief scientific advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, said ""putting absolute timelines on things is not possible"".Doing this could, unintentionally, lead to herd immunity as more and more people were infected. But this could take years to build up, according to Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London: ""We're talking about suppressing transmission at a level whereby, hopefully, only a very small fraction of the country will be infected. ""So eventually, if we continued this for two-plus years, maybe a sufficient fraction of the country at that point might have been infected to give some degree of community protection.""But there is a question mark over whether this immunity will last. Other coronaviruses, which cause common cold symptoms, lead to a very weak immune response and people can catch the same bug multiple times in their lifetime. Alternatives - no clear endpoint""The third option is permanent changes in our behaviour that allow us to keep transmission rates low,"" Prof Woolhouse said.This could include keeping some of the measures that have been put in place. Or introducing rigorous testing and isolation of patients to try to stay on top of any outbreaks.""We did early detection and contact tracing the first time round and it didn't work,"" Prof Woolhouse adds.Developing drugs that can successfully treat a Covid-19 infection could aid the other strategies too.They could be used as soon as people show symptoms in a process called ""transmission control"" to stop them passing it onto others.Or to treat patients in hospital to make the disease less deadly and reduce pressures on intensive care. This would allow countries to cope with more cases before needing to reintroduce lockdowns.Increasing the number of intensive care beds would have a similar effect by increasing the capacity to cope with larger outbreaks. I asked the UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, what his exit strategy was. He told me: ""Long term, clearly a vaccine is one way out of this and we all hope that will happen as quickly as possible.""And that ""globally, science will come up with solutions"".Follow James on Twitter"
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52840763,Coronavirus: The mystery of asymptomatic 'silent spreaders',David Shukman,['31 May 2020'],"As the crisis has unfolded, scientists have discovered more evidence about a strange and worrying feature of the coronavirus. While many people who become infected develop a cough, fever and loss of taste and smell, others have no symptoms at all and never realise they're carrying Covid-19. Researchers say it's vital to understand how many are affected this way and whether ""silent spreaders"" are fuelling the pandemic.When people gathered at a church in Singapore on 19 January, no-one could have realised that the event would have global implications for the spread of coronavirus. It was a Sunday and, as usual, one of the services was being conducted in Mandarin. Among the congregation at The Life Church and Missions, on the ground floor of an office building, was a couple, both aged 56, who'd arrived that morning from China.As they took their seats, they seemed perfectly healthy so there was no reason to think they might be carrying the virus. At that time, a persistent cough was understood to be the most distinctive feature of Covid-19 and it was seen as the most likely way to transmit it. Having no symptoms of the disease should have meant having no chance of spreading it.  The couple left as soon as the service was over. But shortly afterwards, things took a turn for the worse, and in a wholly confusing way. The wife started to become ill on 22 January, followed by her husband two days later. Because they had flown in from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, that was no big surprise.But over the following week, three local people also came down with the disease for no obvious reason, leading to one of Singapore's first and most baffling coronavirus cases. Working out what had happened would lead to a new and disturbing insight into how the virus was so successfully finding new victims.Mobilising 'disease detectives'""We were extremely perplexed,"" says Dr Vernon Lee, head of communicable diseases at Singapore's Ministry of Health. ""People who didn't know one another somehow infected each other,"" while showing no sign of illness. This new batch of cases simply did not make sense, according to what was known about Covid-19 back then.So Dr Lee and his fellow scientists, along with police officers and specialist disease trackers, launched an investigation, generating detailed maps showing who was where and when. This involved the very best of the process known as contact tracing - a version of which is getting under way now in the UK. It's seen as a vital system for tracking down everyone involved in an outbreak and helping to stamp it out, and Singapore is renowned for the skill and speed with which this is carried out.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Early in the pandemic, Singapore was seen as a shining example of how to tackle the virus                Amazingly, within a few days, investigators had spoken to no fewer than 191 members of the church and had found out that 142 of them had been there that Sunday. They quickly established that two of the Singaporeans who became infected had been at the same service as the Chinese couple. ""They could have spoken to each other, greeted each other, during the usual activities of a church service,"" says Dr Lee.That was a useful start and would explain in theory how the infection could have been passed on, apart from one key factor. It did not answer the crucial question of how the virus could have been transmitted by the two Chinese people when at that stage they had shown no indication of having the disease.And on top of that was an even greater puzzle. It was confirmed that the third Singaporean to become infected, a 52-year-old woman, had not been at the same service as the others. Instead she had attended another event in the same church later that day, so how could she have picked up the virus?Evidence no-one expectedInvestigators resorted to going through the CCTV recordings made at the church that Sunday to search for clues. And they stumbled across something completely unexpected - the woman who'd attended the later service, after the Chinese couple had left, had sat in the seats they had used several hours earlier.Somehow, despite having no symptoms and not feeling ill, the Chinese husband and wife had managed to spread the virus. Maybe they'd had it on their hands and touched the seats, maybe their breath carried the infection and it landed on a surface, it's not clear, but the implications were huge.For Dr Lee, piecing everything together, there was only one possible explanation - that the virus was being passed by people who had it without even realising. This was a revelation that would be relevant the world over because the central message of all public health advice on coronavirus has always been to look out for symptoms in yourself and others.But if the virus was also being spread by people without symptoms, silently and invisibly, how could the disease be stopped? He remembers the moment, while working in his office, when the reality dawned on him. ""Every time you make a scientific discovery, it is like a 'eureka' moment when you realise that this is something important that you've uncovered, through the hard work of many individuals and teams.""Spread before symptoms showWhat was revealed was what's known as ""pre-symptomatic transmission"" where someone is unaware of being infected because the cough, fever and other classic symptoms have yet to begin. Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Singapore saw a rise in cases after appearing to have the virus under control                Along with many others, this study highlighted a critical period of 24-to-48 hours before the visible onset of the disease in which people can be highly infectious, perhaps even their most infectious.Being aware of that is potentially invaluable, because as soon as you realise you're ill then everyone you've been in close contact with can be warned to stay at home.That would mean that they would be isolating during the key phase of infection before their own symptoms start. But exactly how the disease can be transmitted without a cough to project droplets containing the virus is still open to debate.One option is that simply breathing or talking to someone can do the job. If the virus is reproducing in the upper respiratory tract at that time then it's possible that some of it will emerge with each exhalation. Anyone close enough, especially indoors, could easily pick it up.And another potential form of transmission is by touch - the virus gets onto someone's hands and they touch another person or a door handle - or a seat in a church. Whatever the route, the virus is clearly exploiting the fact that people are bound to be less vigilant if they're not aware that they might be infected.Some people never show symptoms This is an even more mysterious scenario, and one that scientists simply have no definitive answer to. It's one thing to know that people can be infectious before their symptoms show, quite another when they become infected but never have any sign of it.This is what's known as being ""asymptomatic"" because you are a carrier of the disease but do not suffer in any way yourself. The most famous case is that of an Irish woman who was working as a cook in New York at the beginning of the last century.Image copyrightGetty ImagesWherever Mary Mallon was employed, in house after house, people became ill with typhoid and at least three, maybe many more, died of it, but she was completely unaffected. Eventually a connection was established and it was confirmed that she was the unwitting spreader of the disease.Reporters dubbed her ""Typhoid Mary"", a label she always resented, but the authorities took no chances and kept her in confinement for 23 years until her death in 1938.Assumptions underminedStaff nurse Amelia Powell was shocked when she found out that she is asymptomatic. She was at work on her hospital ward at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in April when a doctor rang to give her the result of a swab test.She had been feeling normal and safe behind the personal protective equipment she had to wear while caring for patients with Covid-19. But suddenly all those assumptions were undermined because, to her horror, she had tested positive. ""It was a bit like hearing that someone in the family had passed, it was surreal. I thought, 'This can't be right, not me, I'm absolutely fine,'"" says 23-year-old Amelia. She had to leave her post straightaway to go into isolation at home.A SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?RISK AT WORK: How exposed is your job?HOW A VIRUS SPREADS: An explanationRECOVERY: How long does it take to get better?""I was worried because I've seen the other side, with patients deteriorating very quickly with it, so I did wonder if this would happen to me."" But, to her surprise, at no point did she feel unwell. ""I had nothing, literally - I was exercising indoors, eating normally, sleeping normally."" At the moment it's impossible to know how many cases of infection exist but remain hidden from view.The discovery that Amelia was infected was only revealed because she was part of a study of all the staff at her hospital. It produced the surprising result that as many as 3% of more than 1,000 people were positive while showing no symptoms at the time of the test.An even greater proportion of asymptomatic cases was found on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which had been sailing off the coast of Japan earlier this year. Later branded ""a petri dish for infection"", it had around 700 cases. Researchers found that three quarters of the people who had tested positive had no symptoms. And at a care home in Washington state more than half the residents were positive but had no sign of the illness.'No single reliable study'Different studies suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many cases are asymptomatic stretching from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects.The upshot, they said, was that ""there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics"". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, ""perhaps a lot of cases"".The risk of 'silent spreaders'The biggest concern of Amelia, the nurse, was that she might have unwittingly transmitted the virus either to those she works with or to the patients who depend on her help. ""I don't think I passed it on because all the colleagues I work with tested negative but it was worrying to think how long I'd been positive for,"" she says. ""But we still don't know if people who are asymptomatic are contagious or not - it's very bizarre and the information about it at the moment is minimal.""One study in China which found that the number of asymptomatic cases was actually greater than those with symptoms had a warning for the authorities. ""As 'silent spreaders',"" the scientists wrote, ""asymptomatic carriers warrant attention as part of disease prevention and control.""Image copyrightGetty ImagesThe team that studied that Diamond Princess reckoned that asymptomatic cases were likely to be less infectious than people with symptoms but even so they're estimated to have caused a significant number of cases. The 'dark matter' of asymptomatic infectionTo try to get an answer, scientists in Norwich are pushing for the population of the entire city to be tested.""Asymptomatic cases may be the 'dark matter' of the epidemic,"" according to Prof Neil Hall, head of the Earlham Institute, a life science research centre, who's leading the initiative. Dark matter is the invisible substance believed to make up most of the matter in the universe, and it's yet to be identified.Prof Hall worries that asymptomatic cases may actually be driving the pandemic, keeping it going despite public health measures. ""If you have people who don't know they're ill while using public transport and health care facilities, inevitably that's going to increase transmission,"" he says.""Any intervention that's only based on people coming to primary health care when they have symptoms will only deal with half the problem."" A team of scientists in California believes that not knowing who's carrying the virus without symptoms is the ""Achilles Heel"" of the fight against the pandemic.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    China launched a mass testing programme in Wuhan                In their view, the only way to stop the disease from spreading is to find out who's infected regardless of whether they think they are or not. That was also the recommendation of MPs on the Commons Science and Technology Committee in a letter to the Prime Minister Boris Johnson.They wrote that the risk of asymptomatic transmission has ""a profound consequence for the management of the pandemic"". And they said that anyone looking after vulnerable people - such as health workers or care workers - should be given regular testing.A similar approach is being adopted on a far larger scale in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic is thought to have begun.As many as 6.5 million people there were tested in as little as nine days in a mass screening programme designed to detect the disease - including in those showing no symptoms.Easing of lockdownAs lockdown measures are eased and more people start to use public transport, return to work or go shopping, getting to grips with the invisible risk matters more than ever. At the moment, there is no way of telling who among the growing crowds may be carrying the virus without knowing.That's why governments the world over say it's essential that everyone cooperates with efforts to trace the contacts of anyone infected and then quickly self-isolates. They also advise that the best defence remains social distancing - to keep apart wherever you can. But where that isn't possible, the recommendation is to cover your face, even with a mask that's homemade.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    More and more governments are advising wearing face masks                When the US government announced this policy, it highlighted the discoveries made in the church in Singapore back in January. The logic is that this is not about protecting yourself, it's about protecting others from you, in case you're infected but don't know it.Many health professionals worry that masks might distract people from hand washing or social distancing, or increase the risk of contamination if they're clumsily handled. But more and more governments, most recently that of the UK, have become convinced of the benefits. Not that face coverings will halt the pandemic on their own. But because there's still so little we know about asymptomatic transmission, almost anything is worth a try.You may also be interested in:When you talk to intensive care doctors across the UK, exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of Covid-19, one phrase emerges time after time: ""We've never seen anything like this before.""They knew a new disease was coming, and they were expecting resources to be stretched by an unknown respiratory infection which had first appeared in China at the end of last year.""It felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the D-Day landings,"" says Barbara Miles, clinical director of intensive care at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, ""with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing"".Read a summary, often in their own words, of what doctors have learnt about how Covid-19 attacks the human body."
https://www.bbc.com/news/53193835,Coronavirus: Why surviving the virus may be just the beginning,Chris Morris,['3 July 2020'],"The first thing Simon Farrell can remember, after being woken from a medically induced coma, is trying to tear off his oxygen mask.He had been in intensive care for 10 days, reliant on a ventilator just to breathe. ""I was trying to pull the mask off my face, and the nurse kept putting it back on,"" he recalls. When doctors woke him up, his body had fought off the worst of Covid-19 but he still needed oxygen to support his damaged lungs. And the 46-year-old father-of-two was suffering from such severe delirium he was trying to deny himself the oxygen he required.""Try to stop me,"" he remembers saying, when nurses at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital said they would have to put his hands in boxing glove-sized medical mittens unless he relaxed.""In the end they had to tape my hands up. I was trying to tear the mittens off, I managed to bite through them, and they had to put new mittens on.""It is not an unfamiliar story for anyone working in intensive care. The assault Covid-19 mounts on the most severely ill means patients are ventilated for longer, and require a deeper level of sedation, than the typical ICU patient.That has produced ""a lot of delirium, confusion and agitation"", explains Dr Kulwant Dhadwal, a consultant who runs the intensive care unit at London's Royal Free Hospital.""Usually if you have a surgical procedure, or normal pneumonia patients come to ICU, you wake them up and they're less confused and less disoriented than this.""""This particular group of patients were a lot more difficult to wean off the ventilator.""Even when that process is a success, it is only the beginning of a long process of physical and psychological recovery. And now the UK has moved past the peak of the virus, attention is turning to the huge challenge - both in the health service and in the community - of rehabilitating Covid-19 survivors.""Often rehabilitation is seen as a Cinderella service and not a priority,"" says Sally Singh, professor of pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation at the University of Leicester.""But because of Covid, and the number of people that it has affected, the need is pressing. It has become a national priority - to support people to get better.""A long roadTens of thousands of people around the UK are now setting out on that journey.Some came close to death in intensive care units, others needed less intrusive hospital treatment to help them through the worst. All of them have had their lives changed by Covid-19.But for the most seriously ill patients in intensive care, rehabilitation begins well before they are woken from a coma. Physical and psychological support has to be there from the start. Even when a patient is asleep, nurses and therapists will move their joints and their bodies to make sure they don't get too stiff.""For example, we have an in-bed bike,"" explains Kate Tantam, a specialist rehabilitation sister in intensive care at University Hospital Plymouth NHS Trust.""Even if a patient is on multiple organ support on a ventilator, and on lots of drugs to keep them alive, we will still put them on a bike.""""We bring it to the bed, and we can put their feet into it, and the machine can then do the work for you.""ICU staff will also talk constantly to patients while they are deeply sedated, telling them where they are, and what is happening to them, and reassuring them that they are safe. It's all part of the process of preparing them for the moment when they are woken up.   ""Some patients do wake up saying, 'I remember your voice,'"" says Kulwant Dhadwal. ""They wake up with some kind of memory.""Image copyrightGetty ImagesBut the process with Covid-19 has proved even more delicate and difficult than normal, partly because so many ICU patients were on mechanical ventilators for extraordinarily long periods of time.Many of them woke up profoundly weak, although some regained strength unexpectedly quickly.""Usually when somebody's been asleep for 40 days or more, it takes six weeks or longer for them to be totally free of the ventilator, to be ready to even start walking or standing,"" Kulwant Dhadwal says.""But some of these patients were making progress within a week, which we found very unusual, very specific to this disease.""Another challenge in the immediate recovery from critical illness with Covid-19 is the severe inflammation.Many patients can't cope with a breathing tube inserted through the mouth because the larynx and the area above the vocal cords are badly swollen as part of the illness. That means doctors have often had to often perform tracheostomies, creating an opening in the neck to gain access to the windpipe, in order to remove the breathing tube that connects patents to the ventilator.""You've got to look after the tracheostomy, it's a wound in the neck,"" explains Carl Waldmann, a consultant in intensive care at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading.""So, it was a long, slow process getting them off the ventilator. It might take them a week or two weeks or even longer."" ""I was nearly a goner""And behind every observation lies a human story.Abraham Raskin's family were told in late April that it was unlikely he would survive. But on 12 June he finally left the Royal London Hospital after more than 50 days in intensive care, a tracheostomy, and a month in a medically induced coma.""The very fact that I'm alive now is a miracle,"" he says, ""I was nearly a goner.""On a video call arranged by nurses on 18 May his family saw his face for the first time since he was taken into hospital in early April. He wasn't able to say anything, but he did raise an eyebrow.Abraham was severely delirious for some time after waking up. ""I was talking all kinds of rubbish,"" he says.""Afterwards when I heard about what I was saying, I felt like I was mad or something. It's not pleasant.""But he is now back at home, still very tired, and following a basic exercise programme planned from him by a physiotherapist. With support from family members, he can get upstairs to sleep at night.  ""Some people can't really walk anymore when they come out of this,"" he says, ""and some take months to recover. I hope I'm not one of them.""DeliriumAs many as three-quarters of intensive care patients who need mechanical ventilation to help them breathe will suffer from delirium. And the observations of many doctors suggest that delirium has been particularly acute, and hallucinations unusually vivid, for people who fall critically ill with Covid-19.Delirium can be caused by the infection itself, and the fevers which accompany it. But it is intensified by the strong sedative drugs that have to be used to keep patients comfortable, and the unsettling environment of intensive care they find themselves in.While patients are in a coma, and after they wake up and begin withdrawing from these drugs, they often experience frightening hallucinations, and cling to unsettling beliefs about what is going on.""Delirium doesn't have a dreamlike quality,"" says Dorothy Wade, the principal health psychologist in intensive care at University College Hospital in London. ""Patients always say 'it was completely real - I was just living in this terrifying alternative reality.'""Doctors think that chemical imbalances prompt the brain to create its own explanation for why the body can't move and the patient can't speak. Often people think they've been kidnapped or tortured, or they think they're in a prison cell about to be put on trial.""They tend to feel that the nurses and the doctors and the staff are all in some conspiracy,"" says Dorothy Wade, ""that this is all part of a conspiracy to make money out of them by selling their blood or their organs.""It means that psychologists like Dr Wade try to step in as early as possible. It's important not to argue with delirious patients, she says, but instead to try to offer reassurance about what has really been happening.Simon Farrell left hospital relatively quickly after being taken off a ventilator, but he still recalls the vivid nature of the delirium he experienced.""I remember Elliott, my younger son, coming into the room in PPE,"" he says. ""Now, that clearly wasn't right. No children were allowed on the ward. The hospital was locked down. It didn't happen.""In his head at the time, though, he believed it to be absolutely true.""You just feel it is what's happening,"" he says. ""And there was a lot worse than that. That was a simple one.""SCHOOLS: When will children be returning?EXERCISE: What are the guidelines on getting out?THE R NUMBER: What it means and why it mattersAIR TRAVELLERS: The new quarantine rulesLOOK-UP TOOL: How many cases in your area?FamilyThe challenge of dealing with the acute delirium that accompanies Covid-19 has been heightened by the fact that family members can't be at the bedside when patients are trying to return to reality. Seriously ill people wake into a world of flashing lights and machines, of disrupted sleep and hospital staff in full PPE.""It has a huge impact on patients,"" explains Krystyna Walton, a consultant in rehabilitation medicine at the Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester. ""They are already confused, and it must be incredibly difficult.""""If somebody has suffered encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and they have memory problems or insight problems, they're not aware of the way that Covid has affected the world, so they can't understand why there are no visitors.""And the social isolation imposed by the pandemic also has repercussions for friends and family.Hannah Farrell, Simon's wife, works as a neuro physiotherapist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where he was a patient. She recalls one evening when he was still severely delirious, a nurse she knew rang and suggested that hearing her voice on the phone might calm Simon down.""Apparently, it settled Simon, but it certainly didn't settle me,"" she says. ""I didn't sleep all night, because Simon just didn't sound like Simon at all.""""For me, it was quite upsetting, and I'm sure other relatives have said the same.""Long-term problemsSome patients can still be delirious weeks after waking up.And delirium, says Kate Tantam, along with other frightening early experiences, ""is the key link to post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression"" among people who survive their time in ICU.Roughly one in five people who pass through intensive care in normal times go on to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). And the signs are that with Covid patients that number could be considerably higher.The same goes for more general anxiety and depression after leaving hospital. The extreme circumstances of the Covid pandemic, and the social isolation that has come with it, are likely to make things worse. The lack of a reassuring family presence, for example, continues to pose additional problems after patients are released from acute hospital wards into care homes and rehabilitation units. Hospitals have invested in iPads to facilitate contact, and family liaison teams make sure video calls take place every day, but it's not quite the same.Image copyrightGetty ImagesKrystyna Walton gives the example of one of her patients who had severe Covid pneumonia, as well as renal failure and dialysis. The patient spent several weeks in critical care, and several more on a medical ward before being moved to a rehabilitation ward with cognitive deficits. They have not been able to see their family for three months.Normally in a rehabilitation unit, staff would try to personalise a patient's surroundings and encourage them to wear their own clothes. But the restrictions surrounding Covid have prevented much of that. And because family members are unable to visit, or speak to medical staff face-to-face, they often struggle to understand just how sick their relative has been.""There are no visitors in care homes, there are no visitors in rehabilitation in the NHS or in the independent sector,"" says Krystyna Walton.""And even after leaving rehab there have been restrictions that we all have had to deal with, which makes it more difficult to visit a vulnerable person in their own home. All of this has a huge psychological impact.""So, the NHS is going to have to prepare for the possibility of a fresh wave of PTSD patients, just as it is trying to deal with a backlog of mental health (and other) cases which have been neglected during the worst of the pandemic. ""We won't know for several months how big a problem this is going to be,"" says Dorothy Wade.""To begin with people are very relieved to be out of hospital, especially after such a long stay. Sometimes it can take quite a long time for them to realise that something still isn't quite right.""It doesn't always turn out that way. Alongside post-traumatic stress, doctors acknowledge the concept of post-traumatic growth, and point to patients who emerge from critical care with a new outlook on life.""There are some people who - no matter how difficult this has been - find themselves in a more positive frame of mind,"" explains Julie Highfield, a consultant clinical psychologist based in intensive care units in Cardiff.""People feel this is a chance they never thought they would have, and they are determined to live their life well.""Simon Farrell is certainly trying to focus on the positive and he has been recovering week by week. But he admits it has to be tinged with realism.""I think people feel if they get physically stronger, they're then mentally stronger and they're fine. And that's not always the case. The two are not aligned.""Physical recoveryFor many people physical recovery can provide the biggest challenge, particularly if they have spent weeks in intensive care.""Covid is a nasty, nasty disease that kicks every single system you've got in the neck,"" says Kate Tantam.And sometimes when people wake up from four weeks of sedation, like thousands of Covid-19 patients have done, the only thing they can move is their fingertips.""We have to rebuild everything with them,"" she says, ""and teach them how to do everything physically again - from being able to feed yourself or being able to touch your hair, to being able to stand and being able to sit.""A prolonged period of recovery is not unusual after intensive care, but many Covid-19 patients have experienced particularly severe fatigue and muscle wasting. They are exhausted - sitting in a chair for half an hour might be followed by four hours sleep. And rebuilding muscle takes time.Image copyrightGetty Images""If we don't give patients the right level of nutritional input, they are not going to recover,"" Kate Tantam says.So, dieticians have an important role to play, alongside physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.  If you have just survived a multi-system disease which attacks different parts of the body in different ways, it stands to reason that you need various forms of help to recover.Many Covid patients will return to normal life relatively quickly. But some have suffered kidney failure and may require ongoing renal support, while others will need to be referred to cardiologists or may have developed neurological conditions that require specialist care.The challenge, says Carl Waldmann, ""is to make sure that everyone gets what they need, and that the right support can be provided at the right time.""""I think the greatest burden will be in the community,"" argues Krystyna Walton, ""because many of these patients will have quite subtle deficits that will only become evident to them as they start recovering physically, weeks and months after going home.""Breathlessness The most common physical challenge for recovering Covid-19 patients is shortness of breath - and that can apply to people who had moderate as well as severe symptoms of the disease.""For patients that are coming out of hospital,"" says Sally Singh, ""clearly they're breathless because they've had a respiratory disease. Their lungs are temporarily damaged, but they are also deconditioned because they've been lying in a hospital bed for so long that they've become pretty unfit.""It means that simple things like going up and down stairs can become extremely challenging, especially in elderly patients.But breathlessness is an issue that goes well beyond survivors of intensive care. And a significant minority of people who've been infected with the coronavirus are still struggling to shake it off.""I'd crash in a heap""Jenny Goldblatt, an infectious diseases doctor at the Royal Free Hospital, fell ill with Covid-19 in March and it has lingered ever since - returning in waves of fatigue, chest pains and breathing difficulties.She spent a couple of days in hospital in March, where she was given a little extra oxygen. But it was only after going home that her problems began in earnest.""Every 10 days or so I'd start to feel a little better and I'd start to go for longer walks,"" she says. ""But then I'd crash in a heap and couldn't get out of bed for a week.""It was a month after falling ill that she first managed to walk to the end of the road and back. A keen cyclist, her next goal is to cycle around the block.""I can't imagine when I will be able to take my bike for a proper ride, and if I think about that too much it gets a bit depressing.""Jenny thinks she has cleared the virus, and she has ""easily detectable"" antibodies in her blood, but her body is continuing to react in unusual ways. Post-viral fatigue is not unique to Covid-19, but this is something more.Jenny has suffered chest pains and breathlessness; other patients with lingering symptoms report severe headaches or abdominal pains. Three months after falling ill, going back to work or resuming normal life is out of the question.""I am getting better slowly,"" she says, ""but I can't be too ambitious. It is frustrating to be on this rollercoaster, with absolutely no idea how long the journey will take.""ChallengesPrevious medical experience with pneumonia suggests it can take months, or in extreme cases years, for patients to get back to where they were before. With Covid-19, we are still early in the cycle of rehabilitation and recovery, and every patient is different.""The honest answer is we don't yet know how long it will take,"" says Sally Singh. ""People are researching that as we speak - monitoring chest x-rays, symptoms and the wellbeing of patients to help us identify what the best intervention to support these people may be.""The trouble is the provision of rehabilitation services across the country can be patchy, especially for people emerging from critical care. And the NHS is already dealing with a massive backlog of non-Covid cases that have been delayed.""The huge challenge,"" says Krystyna Walton, ""is going to be the increase in numbers.""At the peak of the outbreak the priority was to get patients out of acute hospital settings quickly to free up bed space. That means in many cases the rehabilitation assessments that would normally be done in hospital would have been done in the community, or in a care home or a non-specialist rehabilitation setting.Image copyrightGetty Images""And my suspicion,"" Krystyna Walton adds, ""is that many patients may have not had their needs assessed properly.""Carl Waldmann, who has been working on improving the rehabilitation of seriously ill patients for more than 25 years, says one of the best analogies he can think of is building a rocket, and training an astronaut. ""You put them up into space, but you also have to think about where they're going to land and what we're going to do when they get back.""It is the same, he says, if you put a patient through the complexities of intensive care.""We've had some patients who need seven specialists looking after them afterwards,"" he says, ""and unless they have all those bits of the jigsaw puzzle, there is a chance they won't make the recovery they could have made.""It is important to emphasise those rehabilitation needs don't stop after the immediate recovery period. Many patients will suffer from scarring of the lungs - a permanent and often debilitating condition. Doctors also know that a significant number of people who have been critically ill have suffered cognitive deficits. Ideally they should have screening for return to driving a vehicle, and for return to work. ""Rehabilitation has to sort of blur into real life and getting back out into the community,"" says Krystyna Walton, ""doing what you used to do before, looking after your family, earning an income, enjoying leisure facilities and exercise.""""And that is what takes time and expertise.""The NHS and individual hospitals are of course building rehabilitation into their Covid recovery plans, but this is a system that has been overlooked for years. Experts in the field hope, despite all the pressures, that Covid will provide a launch pad for change.""Hospitals are very good at treating people, doing something to somebody to make them better,"" says Kate Tantam. ""But what they are not always very good at is prioritising the therapeutic and rehabilitation input afterwards.""It is, in other words, not just about survival, it is about health-related quality of life.""There is no point giving somebody a massive intensive care stay, if you don't try to return them to where they want to be.""Additional reporting: Oliver BarnesIllustrations: Emma LynchYou may also be interested in:When you talk to intensive care doctors across the UK, exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of Covid-19, one phrase emerges time after time: ""We've never seen anything like this before.""They knew a new disease was coming, and they were expecting resources to be stretched by an unknown respiratory infection which had first appeared in China at the end of last year.And as the number of cases increased, doctors up and down the UK were reading first-hand accounts from colleagues in China, and then in Italy - in scientific journals and on social media - about the intensity of infection.""It felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the D-Day landings,"" says Barbara Miles, clinical director of intensive care at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, ""with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing"".But what arrived in the UK as winter turned into spring took even the most experienced ICU specialists by surprise.

Then, you might need to have your meeting by video conference from a quarantine room, or take a car home or to hospital.If you make it through the lobby, then perhaps you will operate the lift with buttons on your app. Once upstairs, it will tell you when your workstation was last cleaned, Mr Garten says.When it gets to lunchtime, you'll order food by an app, says John Robson, asset director at Workspace, which has 69 office properties around London focusing mainly on small companies.Image copyrightWorkspaceImage caption                    Workers will probably have to spread out more                ""Every transaction is cashless now, and your food will basically be grab and go,"" he says.If you pop to the loo after lunch, you'll be increasingly looking at touchless taps, Mr Lawrence says.New software is helping companies spread people out.Gensler's tool ReRun imports floor plans, calculates safe bubbles around each worker, and then outputs different ways to place workers so their bubbles do not overlap.""Recently we did an analysis on a two million square-foot building that took roughly 10 days to turn around. Otherwise it would've taken several weeks,"" says Mr Lawrence.For the same reason, some companies are looking to teach artificial intelligence (AI) to video cameras.Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Artificial intelligence can look for office ""pinch points""                AI algorithms can offer feedback about ""pinch points"" where people are too close together, while protecting individual privacy, says Dr Mahesh Saptharishi, Motorola Solutions' chief technology officer, based in Boston.Instead of watching the actual video, they can ask the AI how well social distancing is being observed overall, and where problem points are. ""So employees don't feel someone's watching what they do,"" he says.Meanwhile, your cleaner might well be employee of the month for many months to come.An April study in The Lancet Microbe showed the virus can last on plastic and stainless steel (like door handles) for up to seven days, and glass (like screens) for four days.Cleaning wipes can disrupt the layer of fat that surrounds and protects coronavirus. And bleach's active ingredient sodium hypochlorite destroys the crown of protein spikes that gives the virus its name, and the ribonucleic acid (RNA) which is its blueprint to reproduce. So does the ethanol in surgical spirits.But it would be helpful to know which surfaces should be cleaned.Contact tracing needs to keep track of the surfaces and facilities you and sick colleagues used, says Matt Calkins, head of US software development platform Appian, which has also made coronavirus workplace safety software.If you know which of your rooms to target, you know where best to send your deep cleaning team, and maximise use of your bleach, ethanol and wipes, Mr Calkins says.The virus can also be carried in the air, on water droplets or fine dust particles, say researchers. So what about air conditioning systems?Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption                    Office owners will be working hard to make their buildings attractive                The UK government says the risk of air conditioning spreading coronavirus in the workplace is ""extremely low"".Nevertheless, ""we're advising organisations to look at their air conditioning system,"" says Dr Mark Parrish, Northern European medical director from International SOS, which advises companies about medical risks.Filters with extremely narrow openings - like high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and the more powerful ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) ones - can remove coronavirus from circulating in the air, according to UK air filter manufacturer SPCB.The problem is such ventilation systems will normally need stronger fans to push air through these narrower filters, it says.Upgrading air conditioning could be one of many options used by office owners to keep their tenants happy.Maciej Markowski of spaceOS says simple convenience might be the winning factor.""It's ridiculous that you're in a building and it's easier to order food from across town than the restaurant downstairs. Or with three taps on your phone you can tell Amazon a package is broken, but there's no way to tell your building there's a huge spill in front of your office."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53303357,Coronavirus: China's workers and graduates fear for their future,Robin Brant,['7 July 2020'],"Image caption                    Factory worker Huang Xuefeng has seen his salary cut by 50%                Huang waits by a workbench for the welder to pass the next metal tray. There's only a handful of staff in the factory. Half the building is in darkness.The boss is stranded in Europe. They haven't had any new orders from their American customers for months.This is a business that's desperately trying to keep the lights on.""Up until now we haven't received any substantial mass production orders to keep the factory running and to be able to pay salaries and to be able to stay afloat,"" Yuliya Yakubova told me. She was blunt about the business she runs.Speaking from Italy she said, ""The last [thing] I want to do really is fire or let go employees."" But she doesn't have long left.Lotus United is a business that's hanging on. In an industrial park in Jiangsu near China's east coast it makes the rails and the racks for the shops that some of you go to. Or at least it used to.Two floors of manufacturing, around 100 employees, have been reduced to only a handful of staff turning up every day.Most of the machines are now switched off, cardboard boxes stacked up, piles of rusty inventory on the floor.How bad are China's economic woes?China's virus-hit economy shrinks for first time in decadesHuang Xuefeng is not very busy. Before we met there were a few sparks flying over in a corner. The white glow of welding at a workbench.Pay cutsBut the disastrous shutdown brought by the virus has reduced this company to a handful of workers, tucked away in a corner.Huang's had a 50% pay cut. He's now spending the equivalent of just over $200 (£160) a month.""The money I earn now can only guarantee basic living,"" he said. His family has been hit hard because his wife works at the factory too.They are a tiny, tiny part of China's vast wave of migrant workers.When I met him they were eating lunch together during a 25-minute break.If the company goes under they'll lose their pay, and their free lunch. There will be nothing to send back home to their daughter. ""I came here in 2012. [She is being] raised back home as I can't afford it.""Image caption                    Shop fittings maker Lotus United has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic                Privately-owned companies like Lotus create the most new jobs in China. But they are particularly vulnerable in this crisis.In recent years the government and the Communist Party has been more focused on consolidating and protecting state-owned enterprises: the industrial, transport, telecoms and financial giants that they own.Add to this small companies' over-reliance on doing business in the US - it only has American customers - and it is clear that Lotus is very, very vulnerable. One hundred jobs are on the line.Employment of 'paramount importance'An impending unemployment crisis is the stuff of nightmares for China's leaders. The ruling Communist Party worries incessantly about the effects on social stability.Small but visible protests sprang up in Wuhan in April. Workers in a shopping centre gathered to demonstrate against rents they could no longer afford.The official jobless total in China's cities has already hit the government's target. There are independent forecasts that it could go much higher.Image caption                    Only a handful of Lotus United's 100 employees are still working                China's number two politician, Premier Li Keqiang, acknowledged the scale of the problem last month when he said: ""The truth is that in April that figure already hit 6%... Employment is the biggest concern in people's lives. It is something of paramount importance for all families.""Addressing workers at firms like Lotus, Mr Li said: ""Many export companies have no orders now, which has greatly affected their employees.""We must provide support to all these people and businesses in difficulties, but most importantly, we must help them land jobs.""But there is one group the party is particularly worried about: graduates.Under pressureThere are almost nine million graduates entering China's job market this summer.There are fewer jobs to go round. Mr Li has admitted the outlook for them is ""grim"".Image caption                    Zhang does not expect the jobs situation to improve for graduates within a year                Outside a recruitment fair in Shanghai, 23-year-old Zhang told us: ""Yes, we have pressure. We can't find jobs but also we don't want to stay at home doing nothing.""She is pessimistic. ""I expect it won't get better within a year.""Many of the job fairs have gone online. Graduates are looking down a phone camera with a mask on hoping to land their first big job. ""We don't have any internship experience and we didn't go to the autumn job fair,"" Zhang explained.In China's past, the government used to assign jobs to them. But that is long gone.Provincial governments and state-owned firms are being encouraged to recruit graduates. There are tax breaks on offer.This is a critical issue for economic recovery and political legitimacy. Young, educated, unemployed, restless and resentful graduates have repeatedly been a problem for the ruling party.Image caption                    If Huang Xuefeng loses his job in the factory, he will return to farming                Back at the factory, via Italy, Ms Yakubova has her chin up. ""I am hopeful that after one, two, I don't know, three months, let's say in the near future, that we can restart.""Some staff have already quit to find other work. The minimum wage she was forced to put them on was not enough.Huang and his wife are staying, but they have a plan. ""We are under great pressure to live here,"" he said. ""The rent, the cost of living... if we can't hold on we will leave.""They will go back up north if the jobs end, and become corn and wheat farmers again.Millions of migrant workers like them could do the same. It would be an unpredicted reversal of China's decades long vast urbanisation.JOBS: Can my boss force me to go to work?HOLIDAYS: Will I get a summer break?FACE MASKS: When should you wear one?TWO METRES: Could less than 2m work?LOOK-UP TOOL: How many cases in your area?"
