(AP) — Country music firebrand and fiddler Charlie Daniels, who had a hit with Devil Went Down to Georgia, has died at 83.A statement from his publicist said the Country Music Hall of Famer died Monday at a hospital in Hermitage, Tennessee, after doctors said he had a stroke.He had suffered what was described as a mild stroke in January 2010 and had a heart pacemaker implanted in 2013 but continued to perform.Daniels, a singer, guitarist and fiddler, started out as a session musician, even playing on Bob Dylans Nashville Skyline sessions. Beginning in the early 1970s, his five-piece band toured endlessly, sometimes doing 250 shows a year.I can ask people where they are from, and if they say `Waukegan,′ I can say Ive played there. If they say `Baton Rouge,′ I can say Ive played there. Theres not a city we havent played in, Daniels said in 1998.Daniels performed at White House, at the Super Bowl, throughout Europe and often for troops in the Middle East.He played himself in the 1980 John Travolta movie Urban Cowboy and was closely identified with the rise of country music generated by that film. Some of his other hits were Drinkin My Baby Goodbye, Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues and Uneasy Rider.Ive kept people employed for over 20 years and never missed a payroll, Daniels said in 1998. That same year, he received the Pioneer Award from the Academy of Country Music.He is survived by his wife, Hazel, and his son, Charlie Daniels Jr.There are few artists that touched so many different generations in our business than Charlie Daniels did, said Sarah Trahern, CEO of the Country Music Association, in a statement. Today, our community has lost an innovator and advocate of Country Music. Both Charlie and Hazel had become dear friends of mine over the last several years, and I was privileged to be able to celebrate Charlies induction into the Opry as well as tell him that he was going to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.Contemporary country artists like Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean also paid tribute to Daniels on social media. What a hero. A true patriot, Christian, and country music icon. Prayers to his family, said Bryan in a tweet.In the 1990s Daniels softened some of his lyrics from his earlier days when he often was embroiled in controversy.In The Devil Went Down to Georgia, a 1979 song about a fiddling duel between the devil and a whippersnapper named Johnny, Daniels originally called the devil a son of a bitch, but changed it to son of a gun.In his 1980 hit Long Haired Country Boy, he used to sing about being stoned in the morning and drunk in the afternoon. Daniels changed it to I get up in the morning. I get down in the afternoon.I guess Ive mellowed in my old age, Daniels said in 1998.Otherwise, though, he rarely backed down from in-your-face lyrics. Such tough talk earned him guest spots on Politically Incorrect, the G. Gordon Liddy radio show and on C-Span taking comments from viewers.The Devil Went Down to Georgia was No. 1 on the country charts in 1979 and crossed over to the pop charts. It was voted single of the year by the Country Music Association and earned his band a Grammy for best country vocal performance by a duo or group.In the climactic verse, Daniels sang:The devil bowed his head because he knew that hed been beat.He laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnnys feet.Johnny said, Devil just come on back if you ever want to try again.I told you once you son of a (gun), Im the best thats ever been.He hosted regular Volunteer Jam concerts in Nashville in which the performers usually were not announced in advance. Entertainers at these shows included Don Henley, Amy Grant, James Brown, Pat Boone, Bill Monroe, Willie Nelson, Vince Gill, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Alabama, Billy Joel, Little Richard, B.B. King, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eugene Fodor and Woody Herman.Daniels, a native of Wilmington, N.C., played on several Dylan albums as a Nashville recording session guitarist in the late 1960s, including New Morning and Self-Portrait. He also played on albums by Marty Robbins, Claude King, Flatt & Scruggs, Pete Seeger, Leonard Cohen, Al Kooper and Ringo Starr.He also performed gospel music, which earned him Dove Awards as well.Eventually, at the age of 71, he was invited to join the epitome of Nashvilles music establishment, the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted in the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2016.He said in 1998 that he kept touring so much because I have never played those notes perfectly. Ive never sung every song perfectly. Im in competition to be better tonight than I was last night and to be better tomorrow than tonight.Daniels said his favorite place to play was anywhere with a good crowd and a good paycheck."

The issue was whether, by allowing one kind of speech but not others, the exception made the whole law unconstitutional.MORE: What Supreme Court decision on Louisiana law means for U.S. abortion rightsThe court threw out the exception for government-debt collection and preserved the broader prohibition.During arguments, Justice Stephen Breyer got cut off when someone tried calling him.

Police may also apply for a warrant that requires a person suspected of violating the national security law to surrender their travel documents, thus restricting them from leaving Hong Kong.Additionally, under the rules, written notices or restraining orders may be issued to freeze or confiscate property if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is related to an offense endangering national security.WATCH: Why this pro-democracy Hong Kong activist decided to flee his homePlatforms and publishers, as well as internet service providers, may also be ordered to take down electronic messages published that are likely to constitute an offence endangering national security or is likely to cause the occurrence of an offence endangering national security.Service providers who do not comply with such requests could face fines of up to 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,903) and receive jail terms of six months.Individuals who post such messages may also be asked to remove the message, or face similar fines and a jail term of one year.Before the release of the implementation rules on Monday, Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram said that they would deny law enforcement requests for user data in Hong Kong as they assess the effect of the national security law.The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new implementation rules.Under the implementation rules, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam may also authorize police to intercept communications and conduct surveillance to prevent and detect offences endangering national security.Finally, written notices may also be served to a foreign political organisation or Taiwan political organisation, or individual agents, to furnish details on their activities related to Hong Kong. This includes details such as personal particulars, assets, income, and expenditure of the organization in Hong Kong. Failure to comply or providing false or incomplete information can result in a fine of 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,903) or imprisonment of six months or two years respectively.The details of the implementation rules come into effect Tuesday and details were released after the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, chaired by Lam, convened its first meeting on Monday.Hong Kongs national security law, imposed last week following anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, makes secessionist, subversive, and terrorist activities illegal, as well as foreign intervention in the citys internal affairs. Any activities such as shouting slogans or holding up banners and flags calling for the citys independence are a violation of the law regardless of whether violence is used. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment.Critics see it as Beijings boldest step yet to erase the legal firewall between the former British colony and the mainlands authoritarian Communist Party system.Hanscom Smith, U.S. consul general to Hong Kong and Macau, said Monday that it is a tragedy to use the semi-autonomous Chinese territorys new national security law to chip away at freedoms in the Asian financial hub.Using the national security law to erode fundamental freedoms and to create an atmosphere of coercion and self-censorship is a tragedy for Hong Kong, Smith told reporters. Hong Kong has been successful precisely because of its openness and well do everything we can to maintain that.Since the law went into effect, the government has specified that the popular protest slogan Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time has separatist connotations and is thus criminalized.In Hong Kongs public libraries, books by pro-democracy figures have been pulled from the shelves, including those written by prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong and politician Tanya Chan. The authority that runs the libraries said it is reviewing the books in light of the new legislation.Many pro-democracy shops that publicly stood in solidarity with protesters have removed pro-democracy notes and artwork that adorned the walls of their stores, fearful that they might violate the new law.A 23-year-old man, Tong Ying-kit, was the first person in Hong Kong to be charged under the new law, for allegedly driving a motorcycle into a group of policemen while bearing a flag with the Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time slogan.Tong appeared in court Monday facing charges of incitement to secession and terrorist activities. He was denied bail.Separately, pro-democracy activists Agnes Chow, Joshua Wong and Ivan Lam also appeared in court Monday over charges related to a protest last June. Chow pleaded guilty to inciting others to participate in an unlawful assembly, as well as to participating in an unauthorized assembly.News Wrap: Controversial Hong Kong security bill becomes lawWong, who was indicted on similar charges, pleaded not guilty. Lam, who was charged with inciting others to participate in an unlawful assembly, also pleaded not guilty. All three were released on bail.With the risk of our personal safety, with the threat of life sentencing, we might be worried, and also being targeted by Beijing, but we also encourage the global community to let our voice be heard in the world, Wong told reporters Monday. We still hope to let the world know that now is the time to stand with Hong Kong, and now is the time for Hong Kongers to keep our momentum.The cases will move to trial and sentencing following a pretrial review for Wong and Lam scheduled for Aug. 5.A group of about 10 protesters gathered at a shopping mall in Hong Kongs Central business district on Monday holding up signs calling for city leader Carrie Lam to step down, as well as reiterating protesters demands from the pro-democracy movement last year. The demands include an independent inquiry into the police and greater democracy.Others held up blank pieces of paper as a sign of protest against the suppression of political protest in the city. About 20 riot police later entered the mall, detaining protesters holding up signs, although they did not appear to make any arrests.We feel worried that we may be convicted for expressing our views, said protester Anthea Wong. Thats why we are using white paper instead.Associated Press journalist Katie Tam contributed to this report."

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53305721,What is bubonic plague?,Michelle Roberts,['6 July 2020'],"Image copyrightGetty ImagesA suspected case of bubonic plague has been reported to Chinese authorities. It is not known how the patient became infected, but the country is on alert for more cases.Plague is one of the deadliest diseases in human history - but it can now be easily treated with antibiotics.What is bubonic plague?Plague is a potentially lethal infectious disease that is caused by bacteria called Yersinia pestis that live in some animals - mainly rodents - and their fleas. Bubonic plague is the most common form of the disease that people can get. The name comes from the symptoms it causes - painful, swollen lymph nodes or 'buboes' in the groin or armpit. From 2010 to 2015 there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths.Historically, it has also been called the Black Death, in reference to the gangrenous blackening and death of body parts, such as the fingers and toes, that can happen with the illness. What does it do?A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague between two and six days after being infected. Along with the tender, enlarged lymph nodes, that can be as large as a chicken egg, other symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and tiredness. Plague can also affect the lungs, causing a cough, chest pain and difficulty breathing. The bacteria can also enter the bloodstream and cause a condition called septicaemia or sepsis, which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure and death. How can you catch it? People can catch it from:Bites of infected fleasTouching infected animals such as rats and miceInhaling infected respiratory droplets spread by infected people or animalsDomestic cats and dogs can become infected from flea bites or from eating infected rodents. The infection could also enter the body through a cut in the skin if the person came in close contact with an infected animal's blood.The current alert in China forbids the hunting and eating of animals that could carry plague. The body of someone who has died after being infected with plague can infect people who are in close contact, such as those who are preparing the body for burial. Is there a treatment or a cure for it?Prompt treatment with antibiotics is vital. The disease is often lethal if left. Early diagnosis, using laboratory tests on blood and other body samples, can save lives. Could there be a new outbreak or pandemic?Plague still exists in many parts of the world. In recent years there have been outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Madagascar. Although plague has been the cause of widespread disease outbreaks in medieval times, any outbreaks today are thankfully small.Dr Matthew Dryden, consultant microbiologist at the University of Southampton in the UK, said: ""It is good that this has been picked up and reported at an early stage because it can be isolated, treated and spread prevented. ""Bubonic plague is caused by a bacterium and so, unlike Covid-19, is readily treated with antibiotics. So although this might appear alarming, being another major infectious disease emerging from the East, it appears to be a single suspected case which can be readily treated."""

(AP) — Shortly after fireworks above Mount Rushmore disappeared into the night sky on Friday, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem accompanied President Donald Trump aboard Air Force One despite having had close contact with Trumps sons girlfriend, who had tested positive for the coronavirus.Trump has been in a position all along to encounter a virus that spreads from people who dont feel sick, such as Noem, who had interacted closely at a campaign fundraiser with Donald Trump Jr.s girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, who turned out to be sick. Noem didnt wear a mask on the plane and chatted with the president as the flight returned to Washington, D.C., according to her spokesperson, Maggie Seidel.Noem had tested negative for COVID-19 shortly before welcoming Trump to South Dakota on Friday, a day after she had interacted with Guilfoyle. One photo on social media showed Noem and Guilfoyle, who is also a Trump campaign staff member, hugging. The Trump campaign announced that Guilfoyle had tested positive on Friday.Guilfoyles infection prompted some Republicans, such as Rep. Greg Gianforte of Montana, to take precautions against the spread of the coronavirus. He suspended in-person campaigning for his gubernatorial bid after his wife and his running mate both attended a fundraiser with Guilfoyle earlier in the week.Noem doesnt plan anything similar, Seidel said. She cast Noems decision to fly on Air Force One as a demonstration of how to live with the virus. Seidel pointed to comments from the World Health Organization that the spread of the virus is rare from asymptomatic people. But that runs counter to guidance from public health experts, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that advises people to wear masks when interacting with people outside their household.WATCH: How American voters view Trumps handling of racial unrest and COVID-19Asked about Trumps interaction with Noem, the White House noted the frequency with which the president is tested.The president is tested constantly, has tested negative, and those around him are tested as well, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said.When asked why Noem was allowed to travel on Air Force One, McEnany referred the question to the Secret Service, but added: They take the presidents health very seriously. They would never put him in a situation that would put him in harms way.As the number of people hospitalized from COVID-19 in South Dakota has decreased in recent weeks to just 59 people statewide, Noem has doubled down on her relaxed approach to the pandemic. Even as Republican governors in states like Texas have moved to require people to wear masks, Noem didnt require distancing or masks at the July 3 celebration at Mount Rushmore, an outdoor event at which few in the closely packed crowd wore masks.On Friday night, she told the crowd, Tonight, if you look to your left, if you look to your right, youre going to see that this crowd isnt just from South Dakota, but its from everywhere across this nation.The influx of tourists for the Rushmore fireworks has some local leaders and doctors concerned that the area could see a spike in cases. Seidel said the governor worries about other effects of the virus, such as unemployment and domestic violence.When Seidel was asked about a risk to Trumps health from Noems presence on Air Force One, she said, I dont understand why Gov. Noem now needs to manage the presidents medical care."

(AP) — A judge on Monday ordered the Dakota Access pipeline shut down for additional environmental review more than three years after it began pumping oil — handing a victory to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and delivering a blow to President Donald Trumps efforts to weaken public health and environmental protections it views as obstacles to businesses.In a 24-page order, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., wrote that he was mindful of the disruption that shutting down the pipeline would cause, but that it must be done within 30 days. Pipeline owner Energy Transfer plans to ask a court to halt the order and will seek an expedited appeal, spokeswoman Vicki Granado said.The order comes after Boesberg said in April that a more extensive review was necessary than what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers already conducted and that he would consider whether the pipeline should be shuttered during the new assessment.The Court does not reach its decision with blithe disregard for the lives it will affect, Boasberg wrote Monday.Yet, given the seriousness of the Corps NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) error, the impossibility of a simple fix, the fact that Dakota Access did assume much of its economic risk knowingly, and the potential harm each day the pipeline operates, the Court is forced to conclude that the flow of oil must cease, he added.The findings may challenge the legal footing for the Trump administrations most momentous environmental rollbacks. Trump surrounded himself with industry leaders and workers in hard hats this January when he announced plans to overhaul the rules for enforcing NEPA.The Dakota Access pipeline was the subject of months of protests in 2016 and 2017, sometimes violent, during its construction near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border. The tribe pressed litigation against the pipeline even after it began carrying oil from North Dakota across South Dakota and Iowa and to a shipping point in Illinois in June 2017.The $3.8 billion, 1,172-mile (1,886 kilometer) pipeline crosses beneath the Missouri River, just north of the reservation. The tribe draws its water from the river and fears pollution.This pipeline should have never been built here. We told them that from the beginning, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Mike Faith said in a statement.Texas-based Energy Transfer contends proper procedures were followed in granting the original easement for the pipeline, Granado said.The economic implications of the Judges order are too big to ignore and we will do all we can to ensure its continued operation, she said. Billions of dollars in tax and royalty revenue will be lost by state, local and tribal governments in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Farmers will suffer as crude transportation will move to rail, displacing corn, wheat and soy crops that would normally be moved to market. Ironically, the counties along these rail lines will face increased environmental risks due to the increased amount of crude oil traveling by rail.Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, decried what he called a shocking ruling and noted that the pipeline is moving 570,000 barrels of Bakken oil a day.Before the coronavirus pandemic devastated the U.S. oil industry, daily oil production in North Dakota — the nations No. 2 oil producer behind Texas — was at a near-record 1.45 million barrels daily. The states output slipped to below 1 million barrels daily in May amid low energy prices and sparse demand.Permits for the project were originally rejected by the Obama administration, and the Army Corps of Engineers prepared to conduct a full environmental review. In February 2017, after Trump took office, the Corps scrapped the review and granted permits, concluding that running the pipeline under the Missouri River posed no significant environmental issues.The Corps said that opinion was validated after an additional year of review, as ordered by Boasberg, an Obama appointee, in 2017.Boasberg ruled then that the Corps largely complied with environmental law when permitting the pipeline but ordered more review because he said the agency did not adequately consider how an oil spill under the Missouri River might affect the Standing Rock Siouxs fishing and hunting rights, or whether it might disproportionately affect the tribal community.Associated Press writers James MacPherson in Bismarck, N.D., and Ellen Knickmeyer in Oklahoma City contributed to this story."

John Raoux/AP                    This week, DeSantis held a news conference with Florida's secretary of business and professional regulation to announce a crackdown on bars and restaurants that aren't following the guidelines. ""If you go in and it's just like mayhem, like Dance Party USA and it's packed to the rafters, DeSantis said, ""that's not just an innocent mistake."" Florida suspended the license of a bar in the Orlando area. Local officials throughout the state also say they're cracking down on businesses that don't follow guidelines requiring face coverings, social distancing and limiting occupancy. And today's step, suspending the consumption of alcohol at bars statewide, is effectively a new shutdown for the businesses that had only recently reopened. It's also an acknowledgment that some parts of Florida's reopening may have come too fast.  Coronavirus Live Updates Florida's Rising COVID-19 Numbers: What Do They Mean?Officials and doctors in Florida say despite the surge in cases, hospital capacity remains good statewide. Doctors say they're seeing younger people now with COVID-19. In some counties, the median age for those testing positive is now younger than 30. At Orlando Health, a large hospital system in central Florida, Dr. Sunil Desai says of the cases they're seeing, ""The acuity is less, a lot less folks using or requiring mechanical ventilation or the severe presentations of COVID. We're not seeing as much of that."""

Jae C. Hong/AP                    The United States has reached a daily global record for the coronavirus pandemic — reporting more than 55,000 new COVID-19 cases. The daily U.S. tally stood at 55,274 late Thursday, which exceeds the previous single-day record of 54,771 set by Brazil on June 19. Johns Hopkins University & Medicine's Coronavirus Resource Center, which tracks the virus worldwide, says the total number of cases reported in the U.S. stands at 2,739,879, an increase of 53,399 over Wednesday's figure. Brazil has the next highest number of cases with 1,496,858. Russia rounds out the top three with 660,231 cases. U.S. deaths attributed to the coronavirus stands at 128,740. Brazil ranks second with 61,884 deaths and the United Kingdom third with 44,080 deaths. As infections spike in the U.S., a number of states are taking action to try to slow the spread of cases. Florida's surge of COVID-19 cases shows no signs of slowing down. The state Department of Heath reported Florida set another daily record Thursday, with 10,109 cases, surpassing Saturday's record of 9,585 cases. The milestone continues a marked upturn in cases that began last month, weeks after Florida started allowing businesses to reopen.  In Texas, another coronavirus hot spot, wearing face masks is now required in most of the state. Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order on Thursday requiring Texans to wear face coverings in public in counties with 20 or more COVID-19 cases. The announcement comes as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to surge, with the state reporting 7,915 new cases on Thursday. Kansas is also now requiring face coverings after a 46% spike in infections there last week. Gov. Laura Kelly's order, with some exceptions, requires people to wear masks indoors or outdoors where 6 feet of social distancing cannot be maintained. Arizona is contending with one of the worst outbreaks of any state as coronavirus cases surge. Hospitals are bracing for a wave of seriously ill patients, and health officials are pleading with the public to wear masks and heed guidance about social distancing — even in the absence of a second stay-at-home order. Arizona was quick to relax restrictions on businesses and reopen its economy, beginning in early May. Most new cases have come in just the past month. California, another coronavirus epicenter, saw positive tests climb 37% with hospitalizations up 56% over the past two weeks. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department West Hollywood Station stepped up enforcement of an order from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, saying in a Facebook post that it would issue citations that come with a $250 fine and $50 in fees. As the country celebrates the July Fourth holiday weekend, health officials will be on alert. Following May's Memorial Day holiday, coronavirus hospitalizations rose sharply in several states."

Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images                    Updated July 3 at 11:34 a.m. ET With around four out of 10 homes in the U.S. yet to be tallied for the national head count, the Census Bureau has announced the first six places in the U.S. where unresponsive households will get in-person visits starting later this month. Beginning July 16, the bureau's door knockers are fanning out across Idaho, Maine and West Virginia, as well as parts of southeastern Louisiana, northern Missouri and northwestern Oklahoma, the bureau said Wednesday. Households that want to avoid interacting with a census worker at their front door can still fill out a form online, on paper or over the phone. The bureau says it plans to collect responses through the end of October, although attempts to conduct in-person interviews with unresponsive households are set to begin nationwide on Aug. 11. These follow-up visits make up the largest and most expensive operation of the constitutionally mandated count, which determines the distribution of political power and federal funding for the next decade.  The coronavirus pandemic and stay-at-home orders had forced the bureau to push back the start of these visits from May, and now the bureau is beginning to ramp up efforts as the number of COVID-19 cases continue to climb in many parts of the country.   The bureau says it's testing out new procedures for its workers, including social distancing, by trying to conduct interviews this week with around 80 homes in Idaho and in the area surrounding its local office in Nashville, Tenn. The bureau is also under increased scrutiny from some Democratic leaders in Congress, the American Economic Association, the Population Association of America and other census advocates over new political appointments by the Trump administration that have raised fears about an attempt to interfere with the census. In a press release, the bureau says career officials decided where to start these visits based in part on ""the ability of Census Bureau staff to safely resume operations."" In May, the bureau confirmed to NPR that its field workers should each receive 2 ounces of hand sanitizer, a new reusable face mask for every 10 days worked and a pair of gloves for each work day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wear face coverings in public to help prevent spreading the coronavirus to others. But according to the bureau's press release, census workers will wear them ""if masks are required in the area"" where they're knocking on doors. In Idaho, where the bureau says census workers made a few home visits this week and are preparing to do more starting July 16, only a handful of cities have issued requirements for face coverings. The bureau's public information office has not yet responded to NPR's question about why the federal agency is instructing workers to follow local public health guidelines about face coverings and not the CDC's recommendation. Whether the bureau can meet the Constitution's once-a-decade requirement to count every person living in the U.S. largely hinges on the bureau's ability to reach unresponsive homes in these final months for the count. The bureau's research shows that people of color, immigrants and other historically undercounted groups are less likely to participate in the census on their own because of distrust in the government and low awareness about the count's role in determining each state's share of an estimated $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding for public services, as well as congressional seats and Electoral College votes. A recent report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office warns that public health concerns about close interactions could make it more difficult for the bureau to complete door-to-door visits and, in turn, affect the quality of the information collected for the census. On top of these challenges, Tim Olson, the head of field operations for this year's national head count, said in May that the bureau had ""passed the point"" of being able to meet the current legal deadline for reporting the latest state population counts to the president by the end of December. The bureau has asked Congress to pass a new law that would extend that deadline, as well as the one for producing redistricting data to the states, by four months. So far, only Democrats in the House and Senate have introduced bills."

There are some exceptions, such as for children under age 10 and people with certain medical conditions. Masks are also not required during activities including swimming, eating in a restaurant and exercising outdoors while maintaining distance from non-household members.  A list of counties exempt from the face covering requirement will be maintained on the Texas Division of Emergency Management's website.  The order says local officials ""can and should"" enforce the face covering requirement but prohibits jail time as a penalty for violating it. First-time violators will receive a verbal or written warning, with subsequent violations punishable by a fine of up to $250.    Coronavirus Live Updates 'Each Day It's More And More': Houston Hospital Makes Room For COVID-19 Surge CasesThe announcement comes as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to surge, with the state reporting 7,915 new cases on Thursday. In a roughly seven-minute video released Thursday, Abbott said spikes are not just limited to big cities, noting that more than 91 counties have hit record-high numbers in the past three days.  ""These numbers reveal a very stark reality,"" he said. ""COVID-19 is not going away. In fact, it's getting worse. Now more than ever, action by everyone is needed until treatments are available for COVID-19.""  An executive order, issued in April, had prohibited jurisdictions from imposing penalties on people for not wearing face coverings. In mid-June, Abbott allowed counties to require businesses to implement face mask policies.

The proclamation itself mandates, with some exceptions, that people cannot gather in groups of more than 10 people and must maintain 6 feet of distance between people.  This is the latest in a series of moves by Abbott to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus in his state. He announced on June 25 that Texas would pause any further phases of reopening, and the following day he closed bars and tightened restrictions on restaurants, outdoor gatherings and river rafting and tubing businesses."

Peter Dazeley/Getty Images                    By now, it's common knowledge that the coronavirus can be spread by being in close contact with someone who's infected and then breathing in their respiratory droplets. Or by touching a contaminated surface and rubbing your eyes, nose or mouth.  An open letter signed by 239 researchers addressed to the World Health Organization, published Monday in Clinical Infectious Diseases, calls for attention and guidance around a third route of transmission: tiny respiratory particles that float in the air and are called aerosols. They could be responsible for infecting someone who comes along and breathes them in. Researchers are actively debating the importance of aerosol transmission and whether precautionary approaches should be taken even without clear answers about its role in the spread of the coronavirus. ""The ratio is something we need to figure out,"" says Kimberly Prather, an atmospheric chemist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who signed the letter to WHO. Here's what we know about the different modes of transmission:  Droplet What it is: A microscopic virus-filled particle of breath or spittle, around 5 to 10 microns — about the size of a red blood cell — that comes out of the nose or mouth of an infected individual when they breathe, speak, cough or sneeze. Droplets generally fall to the ground within a few feet of the person who expels them.   How a virus could spread this way: Through what researchers call ""the respiratory route."" Virus-laden droplets are expelled from the nose or mouth of an infected person and find their way into nearby eyes, noses and mouths, ""like if you're standing next to your kid and they cough in your face,"" says Seema Lakdawala, a flu researcher at the University of Pittsburgh. How much does it contribute to the spread? Directly coming into contact with respiratory droplets is currently considered the most frequent mode of transmission, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO.  Aerosol What it is: A virus-packed particle, smaller than 5 microns, that's also expelled from an infected person's mouth when breathing, speaking, coughing or sneezing. Unlike a droplet, smaller aerosol particles can remain suspended in the air.  ""They'll continue to float and follow the air streams in a room,"" Prather says. How a virus could spread this way: Through the respiratory route in which a person breathes in clouds of tiny virus particles that have accumulated and may be traveling on air currents. How much does it contribute to the spread? It's an open question that begs more research. ""Aerosols probably have some contribution toward spread, but we don't know to what extent and what situations are most relevant,"" says Abraar Karan, a physician at Harvard Medical School who treats coronavirus patients. Viral spread via air currents has been documented in certain indoor environments: at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where people sitting downstream from an air conditioner caught COVID-19, and at a March choir practice in Washington state, where many choir members got sick with coronavirus after likely breathing in tiny airborne particles generated by individuals who were infected but symptom-free at the time. What's still unclear is how long the virus lingers in the air, how far it travels (possibly through a room but not down the street) and how commonly it spreads this way.  Fomite What it is: An object covered with virus particles, possibly because someone recently sneezed or coughed respiratory droplets onto it, or swiped a germ-covered hand on it. A countertop or a phone could become a fomite in that same manner. The particles could survive from several hours to several days.  Goats and Soda Essential Vocab For COVID-19: From Asymptomatic To ZoonoticHow a virus could spread this way: Through indirect transmission if people touch the surface of a virus-covered object, pick up the virus on their hands and then introduce the virus to their eyes, nose or mouth.  How much does it contribute to the spread?: The CDC describes this as a ""possible"" route of coronavirus transmission but maintains that close contact between people is thought to be responsible for most new infections."

On Wednesday alone there were nearly 50,000 new cases — a record. The case counts for each state suggest the disease is mainly spreading in a band stretching from Florida across much of the southernmost states and westward to California, with Idaho and Iowa also in trouble. But when you use tools to drill down to more local data, the picture gets more complicated — and even more concerning. Here are five takeaways:  Shots - Health News Green, Yellow, Orange Or Red? This New Tool Shows COVID-19 Risk In Your CountyIt may be time for a statewide lockdown in Arizona and Florida  A key measure that epidemiologists track is the number of new coronavirus cases each day as a percentage of the population. (This per capita approach is key because it flags less populous locations that may have a large amount of spread relative to their size — and potentially more cases than their health systems are set up to deal with.) This week a team led by researchers at Harvard came up with a rating tool with four tiers: The highest ""red"" alert level — triggered if a location has more than 25 new cases per day per 100,000 people — means the virus is spreading to such a degree that evidence suggests the only way to get a handle on it is to revert to stay-at-home mode. At this stage even less drastic measures such as massively ramped-up testing and contact tracing probably won't cut it. Technically, three states currently fall in this category: Arizona, Florida and South Carolina. But use the tool to check the situation at the county level, and the virus's reach through Arizona in particular becomes apparent. Nearly two-thirds of the state's counties are in the red zone — compared with about a third of South Carolina's counties.  ""I'm very worried about Arizona,"" says Thomas Tsai, one of the Harvard professors who put together the tool. ""We knew about the outbreak in Navajo Nation. And now we're seeing that that entire northeast corner of Arizona, and realistically, most of Arizona, is becoming red and poses a risk of the pandemic growing out of proportion."" Florida concerns him for the same reason. ""Before the focus was really on the metropolitan areas around Miami,"" Tsai says. ""But now we're seeing that counties in central Florida and even some counties in the panhandle — which had relatively few cases early on in the pandemic — are seeing an escalating rise in cases."" There's trouble in Texas On the one hand Texas offers a sharp contrast. For now, transmission is mainly occurring in the state's large cities, notes Marynia Kolak, leader of a University of Chicago team that has created another tool with county-level data. ""So they have the potential to contain the outbreak before it continues,"" Kolak says. But by another measure Texas is in major trouble. A team from Dartmouth has created a tool that tracks not just how many new cases local areas are seeing per day but how quickly the overall caseload is rising each week. And the top three localities are in Texas — including the Corpus Christi area, where cases rose more than 15% over the past week. (Technically the Dartmouth tool divides areas not by county, but by communities using the same set of hospitals.) Corpus Christi also ranks in the top 10 when it comes to daily new case counts per capita. ""It's a double whammy,"" says Elliott Fisher, who spearheaded the Dartmouth tool. ""It's a place with one of the highest number of new cases and the highest growth rate. So they really need to get their act together."" Other localities in this double-whammy category that he points to include the Victoria and Austin areas in Texas, and — in Florida — Tampa, Miami, Orlando and Jacksonville. Hot spots are cropping up in otherwise better-off states The local-level tools also highlight flare-ups in counties that would otherwise be overlooked because they are in states where the overall spread is not as serious. ""A cluster has to be pretty severe in order for the state to emerge as a hot spot,"" the University of Chicago's Kolak says. Yet the history of the pandemic thus far has shown that isolated flare-ups can eventually widen out with catastrophic consequences. ""Sometimes those progress and grow into larger clusters. Sometimes they don't. So we consider those areas potential emerging risks."" Harvard's Tsai points to Yakima County in Washington state as one that concerns him. Other examples include counties in California and Iowa. But it's worth noting that the vast majority of counties in the Harvard group's red zone are not in the three red zone states. State borders pose a challenge The Chicago group's tool also includes a feature that surfaces emerging regional clusters by identifying counties where the daily per capita new case number is high both there and in neighboring counties. ""What this shows is not just hot spots at a state level, but you start to notice that there's a lot of hot spots occurring along the borders of states,"" Kolak says. Examples include between Southern California and Arizona as well as along the Mississippi River — with cases high in both the Memphis, Tenn., area and across the border in Arkansas. This border issue points up a challenge for states, Kolak says. ""There's definite concern there, because unless you have a federally coordinated response, anything that one of those states does may not necessarily have a full impact unless the nearby states also agree."" The choices that citizens make also play into this, she says. ""So for example, if you're in a state that has very strict social distancing guidelines, but the state next to you has very relaxed ones — driving [there] to get a haircut"" could foment cross-border spread. Ordinary citizens should check the county-level tools While the tools described are mainly helpful to scientists and policymakers trying to detect and respond to broader trends, all of us may benefit from checking them more or less the way we look at the weather report. Dartmouth's Fisher says looking up the new-daily-cases-per-capita measure is a proxy for checking, ""What is the likelihood that the person standing in line with you at a Starbucks [in your county] might give you COVID-19."" Chicago's Kolak agrees. The July Fourth celebrations are largely canceled in her area, she says. But she says she's worried by talk that many people are planning to travel to fireworks displays farther afield. Based on what her county-level mapping tool shows, ""I've been encouraging friends not to go to Iowa for the July [Fourth] fireworks,"" she says. ""In some of those areas, cases are still pretty low. But there are counties that are starting to persistently get flagged as high relative to the nearby areas."""

Dental offices were largely shuttered across the United States after being advised in March by the American Dental Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to close their practices to all but emergency care. Many closed entirely. The hope was that by allowing dentists to continue to treat serious cases — such as intense tooth pain and infections — those patients would stay out of hospital emergency rooms, where medical workers were busy with severely ill coronavirus patients. And because the personal protective gear dentists and other health care providers need was in short supply, routine dental checkups and cleanings were deemed nonessential at least initially.  Shots - Health News My Gym Is Reopening. Is It Safe To Work Out There? Shots - Health News Is It Safe Yet To Get Your Physical Or A Dental Checkup?More recently though, the restrictions against routine care have been loosened in many places. So, is it really safe to go to the dentist now? Can't completely eliminate the coronavirus transmission risk  Dr. Gregory Poland, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic and a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, says he thinks some infections in dental settings are likely to be inevitable. ""But the hope is that recommendations for their practices that all dentists should be following will mitigate that risk,"" Poland says. The concern about the risk of transmission of COVID-19 during a visit to the dentist is understandable. Dental settings have ""unique characteristics that warrant specific infection control considerations,"" says Michele Neuburger, a dental officer for the CDC's Division of Oral Health and a member of the CDC's COVID-19 Response Infection Prevention Control Team. ""Dental health care personnel use instruments such as dental [drills], ultrasonic scalers and air-water syringes that create a visible spray that can contain particle droplets of water, saliva, blood, microorganisms and other debris,"" Neuburger says.   Coronavirus Live Updates CDC Advice On Surface Spread Of COVID-19 'Has Not Changed,' Agency SaysLarge droplets can land directly on others in the exam room and can contaminate frequently touched surfaces. The spray could also include small ""aerosolized"" droplets of COVID-19 if a patient has the virus. And those droplets can remain in the air for up to three hours, according to some estimates, and potentially spread the virus to dental staff or the next patient unless stringent precautions — such as personal protective equipment for staff and disinfection of the treatment room, instruments and surfaces between patients — aren't taken. No cases of COVID-19 traced to dental offices so far Despite these potential risks, the good news is that both the World Health Organization and the CDC say there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 transmitted in a dental office so far. And that includes follow-up by the CDC of news reports suggesting such infections, Neuburger says. In mid-May, in sync with the American Dental Association, the CDC issued more guidance for dental practices, which continues to be periodically updated.  Shots - Health News A Good Dentist Is Hard To Find In Rural America Shots - Health News No-Drill Dentistry: Fluoride Treatments Can Prevent Cavities In AdultsRon Greenberg, 62, a computer science professor at Loyola University in Chicago, returned to his dentist in early June. ""I have been nervous about going anywhere since mid-March,"" he says. But when he finally screwed up the courage for his delayed checkup, the dental office had ""lots of procedures in place"" that made him feel better. A member of the staff called with a list of questions about his health a few days before the appointment, then again on the day of his checkup. Greenberg was told to call the receptionist from his car when he arrived and then wait to let a staffer open the office's front door — so he didn't even need to touch a doorknob. ""They led me straight to the hand sanitizer,"" he says. ""Next was a temperature check. ... Everybody wore masks until I had to take mine off for them to work on me. And the hygienist and dentist had full face shields for when they were working close in."" Greenberg says he was confident enough after experiencing all those extra precautions to schedule a follow-up appointment for several days later to repair a chipped tooth. CDC guidelines: Avoid powered tools where possible Greenberg's visit included many of the precautions recommended by the CDC. These, edited for clarity, include:  Screen patients before each appointment, and when they arrive, for symptoms of COVID-19 — such as cough and fever — and postpone if they have symptoms that could indicate they have the virus. Use each patient's car or a spot outside the office as the waiting room. Remove items such as toys, magazines and coffee stations [which can be infection sources] from waiting rooms. Require masks for patients and anyone with them while in the office area and immediately after procedures and checkups. Place a plastic or glass barrier between patient and reception staff. Avoid using powered tools when possible — some practices no longer use a polisher for teeth cleanings, for example. Leave out only the tools needed for each individual patient so other tools cannot potentially become contaminated. Use rubber dams over a patient's mouth for procedures when possible to limit spray of secretions. Use multiple dental workers when doing aerosol-generating procedures when possible to speed up the visit and minimize exposure. Install high-efficiency particulate air filters to improve room filtration, which might, research suggests, reduce transmission of airborne particles of the virus.  Although a weekly survey by the American Dental Association of dental practices nationwide found that their volume of patients had reached 65% of pre-COVID-19 levels as of June 22, dentists know at least some patients continue to be worried enough to stay away, even if they're in pain or overdue for important procedures such as gum surgery. Delaying checkups or care for dental pain can potentially turn a small cavity into a root canal or tooth extraction and add to treatment time, higher costs and even more pain, says Howard Golan, a dentist in Williston Park, N.Y., who recently reopened his practice after seeing patients only for emergency care since mid-March. In rare cases, he says, missing out on dental care can result in serious infections and even death. Dentists have a vested interest in taking all possible precautions. ""Dentists are typically 12 to 18 inches away from their patients,"" says Louis G. DePaola, associate dean of clinical affairs at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry in Baltimore. ""To do their work dentists have to lean close in to what currently is the most infectious part of a person if they have COVID-19 — their mouth."" Protecting the health of others working in the office is paramount, too. What about the orthodontist? Daniella Smith of Silver Spring, Md., saw her dentist for a cleaning in late May, and that's when she also resumed orthodontist visits for her two children, ages 12 and 15. ""I was pretty impressed by all the new measures,"" says Smith, including staff opening all doors and not using the high-powered polisher during her cleaning. The kids were advised to brush their teeth just before coming to the office, to cut down on saliva being sprayed during an appointment.  Shots - Health News Infection Outbreak Shines Light On Water Risks At Dentist Offices""With all the time and money spent on the kids' braces, we really didn't want their teeth to move back,"" Smith says, ""which is why we made appointments when the office opened back up."" Ideally, dentists would test their patients for the coronavirus ahead of their appointments and reschedule anyone who tested positive. But the ""point of care"" tests that can give results in about 15 minutes can produce false results, says Marko Vujicic, chief economist and vice president at the American Dental Association's Health Policy Institute. ""We're keeping our eyes on testing to see if there will be an effective way we can truly determine the COVID status of patients before treatment,"" Vujicic says. ""Until then, we are advising dentists to take an abundance of caution according to the guidelines when it comes to treating patients."" ""I think everyone is looking for the best science as we go forward,"" says Connie White, president of the Academy of General Dentistry and interim dean for clinical programs at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Dentistry. The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research is soliciting coronavirus-related research proposals on, among other things, ways to improve disinfection and prevent disease transmission.  Meanwhile, White and other dental leaders also say they realize continued upticks in coronavirus cases across the U.S. could result in dental offices being told to shut again in certain regions. ""I hope that's not the case, of course,"" White says. But with openings and closures in flux, it's a good idea to make sure any dental procedure begun during one appointment can be concluded soon thereafter. ""Patients should discuss with their dentist what is necessary to do right now and what can wait,"" White advises. Remember, infectious disease specialists note, that we all have important responsibilities as patients, too, to let the dentist know before or on the day of the appointment if we're feeling sick in any way. We're all in this together — if you're sick, stay home."

But heres what does work,Betsy Mason,"['Jun 10, 2020']","This interview with psychologist Anthony Greenwald was republished with permission from Knowable Magazine. The original article was published on June 4, 2020. A quarter-century ago, social psychologist Anthony Greenwald of the University of Washington developed a test that exposed an uncomfortable aspect of the human mind: People have deep-seated biases of which they are completely unaware. And these hidden attitudes — known as implicit bias — influence the way we act toward each other, often with unintended discriminatory consequences.Since then, Greenwald and his main collaborators, Mahzarin Banaji and Brian Nosek, have used the implicit association test to measure how fast and accurately people associate different social groups with qualities like good and bad. They have developed versions of the test to measure things such as unconscious attitudes about race, gender stereotypes and bias against older people. Those tests have revealed just how pervasive implicit bias is. (Project Implicit offers public versions of the tests on its website here.)The researchers work has also shown how much implicit bias can shape social behavior and decision-making. Even people with the best intentions are influenced by these hidden attitudes, behaving in ways that can create disparities in hiring practices, student evaluations, law enforcement, criminal proceedings — pretty much anywhere people are making decisions that affect others. Such disparities can result from bias against certain groups, or favoritism toward other ones. Today, implicit bias is widely understood to be a cause of unintended discrimination that leads to racial, ethnic, socioeconomic and other inequalities.Discussions around the role of racism and implicit bias in the pattern of unequal treatment of racial minorities by law enforcement are intensifying following a roster of high-profile cases, most recently the killing of George Floyd. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis last month after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyds neck for nearly nine minutes.As awareness of implicit bias and its effects has increased, so has interest in mitigating it. But that is much harder to do than scientists expected, as Greenwald told an audience in Seattle in February at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Greenwald, coauthor of an overview on implicit bias research in the 2020 Annual Review of Psychology, spoke with Knowable Magazine about what does and doesnt work to counter the disparities that implicit bias can produce.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.How do you test for associations that people arent aware they have?The first implicit association test I created was one involving the names of flowers and insects, and words meaning things pleasant or unpleasant. You had to use left and right hands to classify them, tapping on a keyboard as they appeared on the screen. It was a very easy task when you had to use the right hand for both pleasant words and flower names, and the left hand for unpleasant words and insect names, because we typically think of flowers as pleasant and insects as unpleasant.But then the task is switched to force the opposite associations — one hand for insect names and pleasant words, and the other hand for flower names and unpleasant words. When I first tried that reversed form, my response time was about a third of a second slower compared to the first version. And in psychological work where youre asking people to respond rapidly, a third of a second is like an eternity, indicating that some mental processes are going on in this version of the test that are not going on in the other.Then I replaced the flowers and insects with first names of men and women that are easily classified as European American or African American. For me, giving the same response to pleasant words and African American names took an eternity. But when it was the European American names and pleasant words with one hand, and the African American names and the unpleasant words with the other hand, that was something I could zip through. And that was a surprise to me. I would have described myself at that point as someone who is lacking in biases or prejudices of a racial nature. I probably had some biases that I would confess to, but I actually didnt think I had that one.How widespread is implicit bias?That particular implicit bias, the one involving black-white race, shows up in about 70 percent to 75 percent of all Americans who try the test. It shows up more strongly in white Americans and Asian Americans than in mixed-race or African Americans. African Americans, youd think, might show just the reverse effect — that it would be easy for them to put African American together with pleasant and white American together with unpleasant. But no, African Americans show, on average, neither direction of bias on that task.Most people have multiple implicit biases they arent aware of. It is much more widespread than is generally assumed.Is implicit bias a factor in the pattern of police violence such as that seen in the killing of George Floyd on May 25, which sparked the ongoing protests across the country?The problems surfacing in the wake of George Floyds death include all forms of bias, ranging from implicit bias to structural bias built into the operation of police departments, courts and governments, to explicit, intended bias, to hate crime.The best theory of how implicit bias works is that it shapes conscious thought, which in turn guides judgments and decisions. The ABC News correspondent Pierre Thomas expressed this very well recently by saying, Black people feel like they are being treated as suspects first and citizens second. When a black person does something that is open to alternative interpretations, like reaching into a pocket or a cars glove compartment, many people — not just police officers — may think first that its possibly dangerous. But that wouldnt happen in viewing a white person do exactly the same action. The implications of conscious judgment being shaped in this way by an automatic, implicit process of which the perceiver is unaware can assume great importance in outcomes of interactions with police.Do the diversity or implicit bias training programs used by companies and institutions like Starbucks and the Oakland Police Department help reduce bias?Im at the moment very skeptical about most of whats offered under the label of implicit bias training, because the methods being used have not been tested scientifically to indicate that they are effective. And theyre using it without trying to assess whether the training they do is achieving the desired results.I see most implicit bias training as window dressing that looks good both internally to an organization and externally, as if youre concerned and trying to do something. But it can be deployed without actually achieving anything, which makes it in fact counterproductive. After 10 years of doing this stuff and nobody reporting data, I think the logical conclusion is that if it was working, we would have heard about it.Can you tell us about some of the approaches meant to reduce bias that havent worked?Ill give you several examples of techniques that have been tried with the assumption that they would achieve whats sometimes called debiasing or reducing implicit biases. One is exposure to counter-stereotypic examples, like seeing examples of admirable scientists or entertainers or others who are African American alongside examples of whites who are mass murderers. And that produces an immediate effect. You can show that it will actually affect a test result if you measure it within about a half-hour. But it was recently found that when people started to do these tests with longer delays, a day or more, any beneficial effect appears to be gone.Implicit bias is pervasiveHundreds of studies have revealed the workings of implicit bias in a wide range of settings. Here are a few examples that demonstrate how it can occur in just about any situation in which people make decisions that affect other people.In law enforcement: A study found that police in New York City stopped black and Hispanic pedestrians more often than white pedestrians, and a study in Oakland, California, found that black men were far more likely to be handcuffed, searched or arrested than anyone else when stopped by police.In the office: Hiring managers were less likely to invite an obese applicant for an interview, people see older workers as less valuable and bias against Arab-Muslim men influenced hiring decisions in Sweden.In the courtroom: Studies found that implicit bias against African Americans affects almost every step in the judicial system, from prosecutors deciding which cases to charge to judges handing down decisions.In the classroom: Public high school teachers in Sweden gave higher test scores to students with Swedish backgrounds than those with foreign ones, while American psychology students rated young male teachers higher than older men, as well as younger and older women.In the hospital: Doctors were more likely to offer a blood-clot-busting treatment to white patients with acute coronary disease than to black patients with the same symptoms, and nursing students showed a bias against overweight patients.In a pandemic? A study showed that when people feel especially vulnerable to infectious disease, their negative attitudes toward older adults may be heightened.—Betsy MasonOther strategies that havent been very effective include just encouraging people to have a strong intention not to allow themselves to be biased. Or trainers will suggest people do something that they may call thinking slow or pausing before making decisions. Another method that has been tried is meditation. And another strategy is making people aware that they have implicit biases or that implicit biases are pervasive in the population. All these may seem reasonable, but theres no empirical demonstration that they work.Its surprising to me that making people aware of their bias doesnt do anything to mitigate it. Why do you think that is?I think youre right, it is surprising. The mechanisms by which our brains form associations and acquire them from the cultural environment evolved over long periods of time, during which people lived in an environment that was consistent. They were not actually likely to acquire something that they would later have to unlearn, because the environment wasnt going to change. So there may have been no evolutionary pressure for the human brain to develop a method of unlearning the associations.I dont know why we have not succeeded in developing effective techniques to reduce implicit biases as they are measured by the implicit association test. Im not prepared to say that were never going to be able to do it, but I will say that people have been looking for a long time, ever since the test was introduced, which is over 20 years now, and this hasnt been solved yet.Is there anything that does work?I think that a lot can be achieved just by collecting data to document disparities that are occurring as a result of bias. And maybe an easy example is police operations, although it can be applied in many settings. Most police departments keep data on what we know as profiling, though they dont like to call it that. Its what happens in a traffic stop or a pedestrian stop — for example, the stop-and-frisk policy that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has taken heat for. The data of the New York City Police Department for stops of black and white pedestrians and drivers were analyzed, and it was very clear that there were disparities.Once you know where the problem is that has to be solved, its up to the administrators to figure out ways to understand why and how this is happening. Is it happening in just some parts of the city? Is it that the police are just operating more in Harlem than in the white neighborhoods?And once you know whats happening, the next step is what I call discretion elimination. This can be applied when people are making decisions that involve subjective judgment about a person. This could be police officers, employers making hiring or promotion decisions, doctors deciding on a patients treatment, or teachers making decisions about students performance. When those decisions are made with discretion, they are likely to result in unintended disparities. But when those decisions are made based on predetermined, objective criteria that are rigorously applied, they are much less likely to produce disparities.Is there evidence that discretion elimination works?What we know comes from the rare occasions in which the effects of discretion elimination have been recorded and reported. The classic example of this is when major symphony orchestras in the United States started using blind auditions in the 1970s. This was originally done because musicians thought that the auditions were biased in favor of graduates of certain schools like the Juilliard School. They werent concerned about gender discrimination.But as soon as auditions started to be made behind screens so the performer could not be seen, the share of women hired as instrumentalists in major symphony orchestras rose from around 10 percent or 20 percent before 1970 to about 40 percent. This has had a major impact on the rate at which women have become instrumentalists in major symphony orchestras.But these data-collection and discretion-elimination strategies arent commonly used?Not nearly as often as they could. For example, instructors can usually arrange to grade almost anything that a student does without knowing the identity of the student. In an electronic age when you dont learn to recognize peoples handwriting, instructors can grade essays without the students names on them. I used that approach when I was last grading undergraduates in courses. Its easy to use, but its often not used at all.And in many other circumstances it is possible to evaluate performance without knowing the identity of the person being evaluated. But employers and others rarely forgo the opportunity to know the identity of the person theyre evaluating.Can artificial intelligence play a role?People are starting to apply artificial intelligence to the task by mining historical records of past employment decisions. This is a way of taking the decisions that involve human discretion and putting them into the hands of a machine. The idea is to develop algorithms that identify promising applicants by matching their qualities to those of past applicants who turned out to be successful employees.I think its a great thing to try. But so far, efforts with AI have not succeeded, because the historical databases used to develop the algorithms to make these decisions turn out to be biased, too. They incorporate the biases of past decision-makers. One example is how biases affect facial-recognition technology, which inadvertently categorizes African American faces or Asian faces as criminal more often than white faces.READ MORE: Explore Knowables coronavirus coverageThis is a problem that computer scientists are trying to cope with, but some of the people in AI that I have spoken to seem not so optimistic that this will be at all easy to do. But I do think that ultimately — and it might take a while — the biases may be expunged more readily from AI decision algorithms than from human decision-making.Could more be done at the level of an individual company or department?To help prevent unintended discrimination, the leaders of organizations need to decide to track data to see where disparities are occurring. When they discover disparities, they need to try to make changes and then look at the next cycle of data to see if those changes are improving things.Obviously, its easier for them not to do those things. In some cases theres a cost to doing them. And they may think its like opening up Pandoras box if they look closely at the data. I think this is true of many police departments. Theyre bound to find things that theyd rather not see.This article originally appeared in Knowable Magazine, an independent journalistic endeavor from Annual Reviews. Sign up for the newsletter."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-live-answering-your-questions-on-race-in-the-workplace,5 ways to approach racial equity at work,Courtney Vinopal,"['Jun 5, 2020']","The death of George Floyd and the protests that have followed sparked a national dialogue about race in America. For many, discussions about race and the reality of living in America as a black person happen daily. But many households, communities and workplaces are having these conversations for the first time. How can employers and colleagues better support employees of color? What is the most productive way to talk about race in the workplace?Watch this discussion in the video player above.Raël Nelson James, the director of diversity, equity and inclusion at The Bridgespan Group and the PBS NewsHours Stephanie Sy took viewer questions on navigating discussions of race at work.The traumatic events of the past few weeks can be a catalyst to kick off discussions about race, diversity and inclusion in the workplace, James said, but cautioned that employees should be sensitive about how they approach it.  James stressed that allyship is not a destination, and employers will have to put in the work to learn and think deeply about how they can reform their workplace dynamics to better advocate for and uplift diverse talent within their workplaces, as well as commit to pursuing racial equity. Here is some advice from James about how employees can start to think and act on  this in the coming days and weeks.  READ MORE: What we know about George Floyds death in Minneapolis police custodyWhat do employees of color want to see in their workplaces?While workplaces may see the events of the past week as a prime opportunity for rethinking their approach toward race, James cautioned against pursuing too much, too quickly. If your company or your organization is new to multiracial dialogue, I would posit that this week, emotions are too raw to kick off that effort, she said.What folks, I think, need this week is psychologically safe spaces to process this without putting a burden on people of color to be educators, James said, noting that asking black employees to educate, process and absorb the emotions of their white colleagues during a moment of immense social unrest is akin to assigning them a second job. While building multiracial dialogue in the workplace is a valuable goal, James said, Its not something to just dive into this week when tensions and emotions are running high. Multiracial dialogue is a complex, nuanced thing that takes skill to do well, she added, saying that companies should start thinking about hiring a professional who can guide their office to a path toward racial equity before pursuing these efforts on their own. How can white supervisors advocate and make space for their brown and black staff?James said that white supervisors checking in on employees of color should be cautious of asking questions such as are you okay? While it may be well-intentioned, No one is okay, and it comes across as tone-deaf, James said of this approach, particularly during this moment of national crisis. What folks, I think, need this week is psychologically safe spaces to process this without putting a burden on people of color to be educators.Model some of the vulnerability and some of the empathy that one would hope is extended to you as well, James said, noting that while this is a collective moment of grieving and of sadness for black people, it should be a moment of grieving, sadness and outrage for all people.James added that managers and supervisors should think about how they can give their employees of color space to process the traumatic events — in both the short and long-term — as they move forward. On the short-term, for example, they can be more flexible with granting employees leave. In the long run, they should think about how they can root out and eliminate the manifestations of structural racism in their office by supporting and promoting employees of color, diversifying their boards, and bringing in experts specializing in diversity, equity and inclusion to help them in doing so. How can you advocate for racial equity if not in a position of leadership?James said that employees who are hoping to see their office pursue racial equity should seek out colleagues who will identify themselves as allies and work on this alongside them. At James organization, The Bridgespan Group, they did something similar after the death of Michael Brown in 2014. It was a similarly difficult time where black folks and other people of color were navigating this sort of grief and wondering if anyone else was having a similar experience in the workplace, James said. After gathering together, James said, Bridgespan formed a racial equity working group to help shepherd their commitment to racial equity.She encouraged employees seeking this in the workplace to create a space where others can raise their hand, identify themselves as allies, identify themselves as other people who want to work on this with you.Are there ways employees can engage beyond their social media accounts?Asked about the recent surge of posts circulating on social media in support of the black community, James said that while she understands people may be processing this moment in different ways, the best way to support black colleagues and friends is to reach out in person to those with whom you already share an authentic relationship. Intellectually I understand why the deaths of George Floyd and Tony McDade and Breonna Taylor have created a crescendo in this moment, James said of the recent flood of interest in Black Lives Matter and other movements against police brutality on social media. But she said that reaching out to a colleague simply because they are black and especially if you dont have a preexisting rapport with them is unhelpful and its draining during a time when we are already exhausted.Instead, James said, you can reach out to comfort and support black colleagues with whom you feel close. Alternatively, she said you should ask yourself, have I done the things … to build relationships with the black people in my community at my job, do I have that kind of trustful relationship? If you havent, consider making a personal commitment to donate money or take a class on inclusive management, for example. James said that making a commitment to do better by colleagues of color will mean more for this community in the long run than emails, texts, or other performative displays of support such as social media posts. Why color blindness misses the markWhile it may be tempting to shift the focus away from race in an effort to boost unity at a moment like this, James cautioned against doing so. Color blindness fundamentally misses the mark by erasing something thats fundamental to peoples identity and peoples self-love, said James, noting that being black is a centering and central part of her identity and she wants people to appreciate her because of that, not in spite of it.  She added that black Americans have spent their lives learning about whiteness and what it means to be white in the U.S., but said that white people might be hesitant to reciprocate that. Instead of pushing the issue away, James recommended that workplace employees lean into the kind of discomfort it might take to become an ally to marginalized communities and devote themselves to pursuing that path.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/two-thirds-of-black-americans-dont-trust-the-police-to-treat-them-equally-most-white-americans-do,Two-thirds of black Americans dont trust the police to treat them equally. Most white Americans do.,Laura Santhanam,"['Jun 5, 2020']","Nearly half of black Americans have very little or no confidence that police officers in their community treat people with different skin colors the same, according to the latest PBS NewsHour-NPR-Marist poll. But overall, only 18 percent of Americans take that view — an illustration in itself that people of different races are living different realities in the United States. In the days since George Floyds death cracked open the country with demonstrations of people calling for the end of racism in policing, a third of all Americans — 35 percent — said they have a great deal of confidence that police officers in their communities treat black and white people equally, in this poll conducted June 2-3.Community trust in law enforcement has eroded somewhat over the past few years, as police-involved killings of black people have come to national attention, prompting pain and outrage. In December 2014, months after the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, a larger number — 41 percent of Americans — had a high degree of confidence in police.Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourBlack communities are often over-policed and over-profiled, which can even lead to fatality, as recent cases have shown us, said Dr. Michael Lindsey, who directs the McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research at New York University and has studied the effects of racism on mental health in black youth. Will an interaction with the police result in an outcome characterized by physical harm or unequal treatment by the court system? That is a real concern for black Americans.To Lindsey, the views expressed in this nationally representative poll of 1,062 U.S. adults correspond with a history of negative interactions and experiences between the police and blacks.A 2019 study showed that black men and boys face much higher risk of being killed by police in their lifetimes — 96 deaths out of 100,000 are at the hands of police — than do white men and boys, whose likelihood of death by cop is 39 out of 100,000. While this poll asked specifically about perceptions about policing of black and white people, reports of police violence in brown communities have also gained greater awareness in recent years.Protest or unlawfulness?Floyds death and some of his last words, I cant breathe — the same words spoken by Eric Garner, another black man whose death after being restrained by police was caught on video — ignited protests last week that have spread to dozens of cities across the country and show no signs of stopping. Some protests have exploded into intentional acts of property damage and ransacking of stores, and been marked by sometimes debilitating or deadly use of force by police.I had seen police brutality already, in real life and on [the TV], protester Devin Hinnant told PBS NewsHours Yamiche Alcindor in Washington. But something about hearing Floyd say, I cant breathe, made Hinnant feel he needed to know why that officer thought it was permissible to keep his knee on that mans neck, three minutes after he died.In the U.S., nearly two-thirds of Americans view the rallies and marches as mostly legitimate protests. That includes 87 percent of Democrats and 65 percent of independents. Just 28 percent of U.S. adults overall believe people are mostly acting unlawfully, including a higher proportion of Republicans —  59 percent. Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourThe protests have exposed generational fault lines on issues of race,with nearly three-quarters of Gen Z and millennials — those aged 18-39 — believing the protests are legitimate, compared to 60 percent of Generation X, 55 percent of baby boomers, and 48 percent of those over the age of 74. In many communities where people demonstrated, police used rubber bullets and tear gas to control crowds, in some cases severely injuring people. In one instance, photographer Linda Tirado lost sight in one eye after she said she was shot with a rubber bullet during a protest in Minneapolis. The citys police department disputed the claim.

Another 38 percent said police have mostly responded appropriately, including 41 percent of white Americans, 39 percent of Latinos and 32 percent of African Americans. Only 18 percent think police werent acting aggressively enough, including 20 percent of white respondents, 13 percent of Latinos, and 6 percent of African Americans.Trumps response to demonstrationsSixty-seven percent of Americans think President Donald Trump has mostly increased tensions since Floyds death, while 18 percent believe he has mostly decreased tensions.Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHourOn May 29, Trump called protesters thugs and suggested he would respond with military force to control the situation, drawing criticism for stoking tensions.  These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I wont let that happen, Trump tweeted. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. In an unprecedented move, Twitter hid the tweet on his timeline behind a warning that said it violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence.READ MORE: Trumps tweet about rioters echoes 1960s Miami police chief"

The trip also marks the president's first campaign rally in a political battleground state and second mega-event since his hiatus from the trail due to the coronavirus pandemic. The president's reelection campaign announced Sunday that the rally will take place at Portsmouth International Airport at 8 p.m. ET. According to a statement released by the Trump campaign, the outdoor event will feature ""ample access to hand sanitizer"" and all attendees ""will be provided a face mask that they are strongly encouraged to wear."" Trump campaign officials tell CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga that all attendees will also be required to pass a temperature check upon entry. Though the event will technically take place on federal land at the former site of Pease Air Force Base, the Trump campaign has coordinated with Governor Chris Sununu's office and state officials ahead of Saturday's event.There have been over 5,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases in New Hampshire, and more than 380 deaths, according to the state's Department of Public Health. Nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire residents disapprove of Mr. Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a University of New Hampshire survey released last month. In a survey of New Hampshire voters released last month, Mr. Trump trails Joe Biden. The presumptive Democratic nominee led the GOP incumbent 49% to 42% among registered voters, according to the Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll. Mr. Trump last visited the Granite State on February 10, which was the eve of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, for a crowded indoor rally in downtown Manchester. But it was in 2011 that then-real estate mogul Donald Trump first dropped into Portsmouth International Airport in a Trump-emblazoned black helicopter to explore a GOP primary bid, after pushing false rumors that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.The upcoming rally, just a few short miles from the Maine border, is expected to also draw supporters from the neighboring state. In 2016, Mr. Trump won Maine's 2nd congressional district, making him the first Republican to score Maine electoral votes since George H. W. Bush in 1988. The Republican mayor of the Democratic-leaning city of Portsmouth, Rick Becksted, said he learned of the rally Sunday evening while watching the news and receiving email inquiries.      Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxFROM THE CANDIDATESJOE BIDENJoe Biden continues to chart a rhetorical contrast on Mr. Trump's declared ""war"" on cancel culture and the debate over racial equality in the country, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. The Biden campaign said it was clear after Friday's presidential address at Mount Rushmore that the ""divisive president … doesn't give a damn about anything but his own gain."" In his Independence Day message, Biden cited notes of history on slavery and the Civil War as examples of work still needed to fulfill the country's founding promise ""that all men [and women] are created equal."" The former vice president didn't appear anywhere publicly for the Fourth of July as his focus has been hyper cognizant on social distancing guidelines from both federal officials and officials in his home state of Delaware. Monday was another day without public appearances for Biden but his campaign announced their senior Florida ground game team, adding to the handful of battleground states where the Democrats have a physical staffing presence.  VEEPSTAKESELIZABETH WARRENTrail Markers                2020 Daily Trail Markers: Trump campaign schedules next rally to be outdoors                              Daily Trail Markers: Trump, Biden spar over jobs report as cases spike                              Daily Trail Markers: Wisconsin court won't expedite voter purge case                              Daily Trail Markers: Biden responds to Russian bounty intel reports                              2020 Daily Trail Markers: Supreme Court affirms abortion protections                          More in Trail Markers            Senator Elizabeth Warren is asking the country's largest food and beverage processors and farm operators to disclose what they're doing to protect their workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic, according to CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. In a letter to companies including Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz sent last week and released Monday, Warren along with Senators Jeff Merkley and Cory Booker wrote that failing to take substantial virus protection measures could have impacts beyond the health of their workers. ""Outbreaks in your facilities could threaten the broader food supply chain by further exacerbating existing labor shortages and reducing plant processing capacity,"" they wrote. ""Given the increasing consolidation of your industry, both producers and consumers could be left with limited alternatives, negatively affecting market opportunities for farmers and creating potential shortages for consumers."" In June, Warren and Booker had raised similar concerns about worker safety at meatpacking plants.KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMSAtlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced Monday on Twitter that she has tested positive for COVID-19. Bottoms later said in an interview on MSNBC that the news came as a shock to her, as she had only experienced mild allergy-like symptoms. ""This is startling for me because we've been so very careful. But certainly we are not immune."" Bottoms said in the interview and added, ""This is just a lesson to everyone. That you have to take every single symptom seriously as I see this growing list of symptoms. We can't assume that it's seasonal allergies. We can't assume that a mild cough, I get a seasonal allergies. We all need to be tested."" CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry reports that members of Bottoms' team have begun contact tracing measures. The mayor recently met with the family members of Secoriea Turner, a young girl who was murdered in Atlanta over the weekend.  Bottoms will quarantine in her home for the next two weeks.LEGAL MATTERSSUPREME DECISIONSThe Supreme Court on Monday said states can require presidential electors to cast their votes for their party's candidate that won the state's popular vote, upholding state laws that punish so-called ""faithless electors"" who break their pledge and vote for a candidate other than the one who won the state's popular vote. CBS News digital reporter Melissa Quinn says the high court was unanimous in its ruling that the laws at issue in a pair of disputes from Washington and Colorado are constitutional. The decision from the Supreme Court comes just months ahead of the November general election, when voters will head to the polls to elect a president and vice president. ""The Constitution's text and the nation's history both support allowing a state to enforce an elector's pledge to support his party's nominee — and the state voters' choice — for president,"" Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court. Justice Sonia Sotomayor took no part in the decision of the dispute involving faithless electors in Colorado. The justices heard arguments in the disputes, the last of its term, via teleconference, as the court was forced to alter the format of arguments because of the coronavirus pandemic.STATE-BY-STATENEVADAThe Nevada State Democratic Party marked the launch of their coordinated campaign with ""virtual ice cream socials"" across the state over the weekend, with ""more than two dozen new field organizers"" hired in the past month as they race to ramp up their operation ahead of the general election, reports CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Biden's team in Nevada has also brought on another new top aide, Elizabeth Warren campaign alum Kevin Liao, to serve as their Nevada communications director. ""We've built up a strong field program across 2016 and 2018 and, this year, we're taking nothing for granted,"" Shelby Wiltz, head of the state party's coordinated campaign, said in a statement. GOVERNOR'S MANSION UTAHIn Utah's Republican gubernatorial primary, Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox has beaten former Governor and U.S. ambassador to China Jon Huntsman. The race was June 30, but due to the close initial margin and counting of mail ballots, the Associated Press called the race Monday afternoon. Cox captured 36.4% of the vote, while Huntsman had 34.6%. Cox is the favorite against Democrat law Professor Chris Harrison in November, since there hasn't been a Democratic governor since 1985.   CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGEIN THE HOUSENEW JERSEYOriginally slated for June 2 but postponed due to coronavirus, 12 House districts and one Senate seat will be on the ballot Tuesday in New Jersey. Some of the races to watch include a Kennedy, a progressive challenger to a Democrat incumbent, and a heated Republican primary for a targeted seat. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro has more below on some of the races to watch.New Jersey's 2ndAmy Kennedy and political science professor Brigid Callahan Harrison are leading the Democratic primary to challenge Congressman Jeff Van Drew, who notably switched parties during the impeachment process. Kennedy, an educator and wife of former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy, has the endorsements of Governor Phil Murphy and the Atlantic County Democratic Party, where one-third of voters reside. Harrison originally filed to primary Van Drew the week he voted against impeachment, and has been backed by six county chairs as well as Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker.  Another candidate in the running is Will Cunningham, a former congressional staffer who ran against Van Drew in the 2018 primary. New Jersey's 3rdDemocrat freshman Andy Kim is among the top targets for national Republicans, as Mr. Trump won this district by 6 points in 2016 before Kim narrowly flipped it in the midterms. In his district is a competitive GOP primary between engineer & lawyer David Richter and Kate Gibbs, a former elected official in Burlington County. Richter has loaned his campaign more money, but Gibbs has gotten support from outside groups such as the Defending Main Street PAC. New Jersey's 5thCongressman Josh Gottheimer is facing a challenge from the left with local Councilwoman Arati Kreibich. Kreibich has recently been backed by progressive stalwarts like Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders. Gottheimer, who is in his second term, has the backing of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Representatives Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey.  Gottheimer is currently co-chair of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, and Kreibich's campaign has looked to tie Gottheimer's focus on bipartisanship to the Republican party and Wall Street. Internal Gottheimer polls have him with a safe lead (62% to 21%), while Kreibich's internal polling shows her within a two-point margin after respondents were given more information about her platform and messaging. Both campaigns are prepared for results to come in later than Tuesday night due to the influx of mail-in ballots.AND IN CASE YOU MISSED IT…CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar and Nicole Sganga join CBSN to talk about their reporting in California and Maine for CBS News COVID Chronicles.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-connected-lobbyists-secure-coronavirus-financial-aid/,Trump-connected lobbyists reap windfall in COVID-19 boom,[],"['July 6, 2020']","Washington — Forty lobbyists with ties to President Donald Trump helped clients secure more than $10 billion in federal coronavirus aid, among them five former administration officials whose work potentially violates Trump's own ethics policy, according to a report.The lobbyists identified Monday by the watchdog group Public Citizen either worked in the Trump executive branch, served on his campaign, were part of the committee that raised money for inaugural festivities or were part of his presidential transition. Many are donors to Trump's campaigns, and some are prolific fundraisers for his reelection.They include Brian Ballard, who served on the transition, is the finance chair for the Republican National Committee and has bundled more than $1 million for Trump's fundraising committees. He was hired in March by Laundrylux, a supplier of commercial laundry machines, after the Department of Homeland Security issued guidance that didn't include laundromats as essential businesses that could stay open during the lockdown. A week later, the administration issued new guidance adding laundromats to the list.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxDave Urban, a Trump adviser and confidant, has collected more than $2.3 million in lobbying fees this year. The firm he leads, American Continental Group, represents 15 companies, including Walgreens and the parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, on coronavirus issues.Trump pledged to clamp down on Washington's influence peddling with a ""drain the swamp"" campaign mantra. But during his administration, the lobbying industry has flourished, a trend that intensified once Congress passed more than $3.6 trillion in coronavirus stimulus.While the money is intended as a lifeline to a nation whose economy has been upended by the pandemic, it also jump-started a familiar lobbying bonanza.

""These (lobbying) booms that these people are having, you can really attribute them to their connection to Trump.""The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Shortly after Trump took office, he issued an executive order prohibiting former administration officials from lobbying the agency or office where they were formerly employed, for a period of five years. Another section of the order forbids lobbying the administration by former political appointees for the remainder of Trump's time in office.Yet five lobbyists who are former administration officials have potentially done just that during the coronavirus lobbying boom:— Courtney Lawrence was a former deputy assistant secretary for legislation in the Department of Health and Human Services in 2017 and 2018. She became a lobbyist for Cigna in 2018 and is listed as part of a team that has lobbied HHS, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and at least two other agencies. Cigna did not respond to a request for comment.— Shannon McGahn, the wife of former White House counsel Don McGahn, worked in 2017 and 2018 as a counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. She then joined the National Association of Realtors as its top lobbyist and is listed on disclosures as part of a team that has lobbied both houses of Congress, plus six agencies, including the Treasury Department. The Realtors association did not respond to a request for comment.— Jordan Stoick is the vice president of government relations at the National Association of Manufacturers. Stoick's biography on NAM's website indicates that he is ""NAM's lead lobbyist in Washington,"" where he started working after serving as a senior adviser in the Treasury Department. Disclosures indicate that Stoick and his colleagues lobbied both houses of Congress plus at least five executive branch agencies, including Treasury.""NAM carefully adheres to the legal and ethical rules regulating lobbying activity, including ensuring that its employees comply with all applicable prohibitions on contacting their former employers,"" Linda Kelly, the organization's general counsel, said in a statement.— Geoffrey Burr joined the firm Brownstein Hyatt after serving as chief of staff to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. The firm's lobbying disclosure for the first quarter of 2020 includes Burr on a list of lobbyists who contacted the White House and Congress on coronavirus-related matters on behalf of McDonald's.— Emily Felder joined Brownstein Hyatt after leaving the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, where she worked in the legislative office. Felder is listed on a disclosure from the first quarter of 2020 that shows she was part of a team that lobbied Congress and the White House.A spokeswoman for the firm said both Felder and Burr abide by the Trump administration's ethics rules, which limit their lobbying to the House and the Senate.""We are confident that our lobbyists are in compliance with all lobbying rules and applicable prohibitions and did not violate their Trump Administration pledge,"" spokeswoman Lara Day said in a statement.Public Citizen's Craig Holman, who himself is a registered lobbyist, said the group intends to file ethics complaints with the White House. But he's not optimistic that they will lead to anything. Last year, he filed more than 30 complaints, all of which were either ignored or rejected.""There does not appear to be anyone who is enforcing the executive order,"" Holman said."

Jones, a 50-year-old homeless black man diagnosed with schizophrenia, had violated an ordinance in Martinsburg, West Virginia, that requires all pedestrians to use the sidewalk.When an officer asked if he was carrying a weapon, Jones fled the scene, according to court documents. Officers caught up with Jones and tried taking him into custody. They tased, kicked and put Jones in a chokehold. Five officers surrounded Jones, and when one accused Jones of stabbing him, the officers stood back and ordered him to drop a knife that officers spotted. Jones, who remained motionless on the ground despite the officers' commands, was shot 22 times, the documents said.""The video was the second hardest thing I had to watch, the first was watching my mother in tears when I told her,"" Bruce Jones, Wayne's younger brother, told CBS News. ""If walking down the street is a crime, the worst that should've happened was they arrested him. They didn't have to form a semi-circle and execute him.""Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxAn appeals court recently sided with Jones' family, reviving the case which had previously been denied on grounds of qualified immunity, the legal doctrine that protects government officials from civil lawsuits unless victims can show officers violated ""clearly established"" constitutional or statutory rights. Jones' case will now go back to the federal district court, a rare second chance for police brutality suits. Qualified immunity, which the Supreme Court created decades ago, has become a focal point of the debate on policing following the death of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody in May. Activists believe reforming the doctrine could increase the accountability of law enforcement. On Capitol Hill, House Democrats recently passed a bill that calls for eliminating the doctrine. Senator Mike Braun, a Republican from Indiana, introduced legislation that would scale back qualified immunity and that says government officials can only claim the protection when they prove their conduct had previously been authorized by federal or state law.Police Reform & Racial Justice                Qualified immunity is at the forefront of the debate on policing                              Formula One drivers take a knee in anti-racism campaign                              Floyd's former partner and Brooks' widow share a ""spiritual"" bond                              Three officers charged in George Floyd's death are now out on bail                              Photo shows officers reenacting chokehold on Elijah McClain                          More in Police Reform & Racial Justice            Meanwhile, Republicans introduced a policing reform bill that leaves the issue off the table. Senator Tim Scott told ""Face the Nation"" amending qualified immunity would be a ""poison pill"" for getting any legislation passed, and President Trump has threatened to veto any such measure. Tim Scott: Ending immunity a ""poison pill"" in...08:00The doctrine requires families to find nearly identical cases of excessive force that prove what officers did was unconstitutional. For example, a homeless man in Tennessee sued after a police dog bit him during a 2014 arrest. A previous case found it unconstitutional for officers to deploy a dog if someone surrendered and was lying down. The Supreme Court denied the petition, arguing that it wasn't similar enough because the man, in this case, was sitting, instead of lying on the ground.The Supreme Court created the doctrine in 1967 to provide government officials a ""good faith"" defense if they believed their conduct was legal. It was spurred by a case where two Mississippi police officers arrested and jailed 15 priests, three of whom were black, for refusing to leave a segregated bus terminal waiting room in 1961. The group sued for false imprisonment, but the court sided with the officers who said they believed they were preventing imminent violence from a crowd.   Now, advocates of qualified immunity believe eliminating it would subject police departments to frivolous lawsuits and lead to a mass exit of officers from the workforce. Patrick Yoes, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, testified before the Senate last week, saying the doctrine grants officers the discretion to make split-second decisions when their lives could be at risk. He said his organization, which represents 350,000 members, was strongly opposed to ending qualified immunity.Jack Collins, a legal adviser for the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said removing the protection would be ""counterproductive"" toward efforts to create a more accountable system because it would hurt departments' abilities to recruit and retain qualified officers.""For those bad people, they're not going to be prevented from doing bad, ugly things because you subject every officer to frivolous lawsuits,"" he added. ""Abolishing qualified immunity is just a really false effort by people who are frustrated, with good reason, at some bad cops, but you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.""Joanna Schwartz, a professor at UCLA Law, said weak cases against officers are often weeded out by the system. According to her study of nearly 1,200 lawsuits, fewer than 4% of the cases were dismissed on qualified immunity grounds. Experts said other factors often kill cases before the doctrine can even be invoked, including procedural barriers and challenges to bringing claims in the first place. Bruce Jones believes the ""system isn't made to work"" for people who can't financially afford to go up against police. He said he hopes the prospect of a long legal battle doesn't deter other alleged victims of police brutality from taking action. ""I would tell them if they still have a chance to fight for justice, fight for justice,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, even sometimes when there's a camera you can't get justice because there's always an excuse or an explanation, but never give up fighting for your rights.""Melissa Quinn contributed to this report."
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uscis-funding-13400-immigration-workers-furlough-coronavirus/,"Standoff over emergency funding leaves 13,400 immigration workers facing furlough",['Camilo Montoya'],"['July 6, 2020']","In less than 30 days, the cash-strapped U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will start furloughing more than 13,400 employees — nearly 70% of its workforce — unless Congress authorizes emergency funding to avoid a scenario that would cripple the nation's legal immigration system.USCIS — which administers green card applications, work permits, asylum requests, naturalization ceremonies for would-be U.S. citizens and other immigration services — has been facing an unprecedented financial crisis, which it attributes to a drastic decrease in applications during the coronavirus pandemic that has deprived the fee-funded agency of its main source of revenue. Thousands of USCIS employees have already received notices of their looming furloughs, which would start on August 3. ""If that happens, the agency would be left with a skeleton crew that will make it difficult to sustain our critical mission of administering our nation's lawful immigration system,"" Joseph Edlow, deputy director for policy at USCIS and the de facto head of the agency, said in a statement to CBS News.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxUSCIS, which is a division of the Department of Homeland Security, informed Congress of its financial woes in the middle of May, requesting $1.2 billion in emergency funding and promising to repay the funds by imposing a 10% surcharge on applications. However, in the ensuing weeks, a standoff has emerged between Congress and the Trump administration, leaving a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the USCIS workforce and the millions of immigrants who file petitions with the agency in any given year.People take the oath of citizenship during a naturalization ceremony at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service's Field Office on Thursday, July 2, 2020, in New York.                        Frank Franklin II / AP                      Democratic and Republican congressional officials said the administration has yet to file a formal budget request, frustrating the lawmakers responsible for authorizing the funds. ""It's a moving target right now in terms of what specifically it is that we need to address in order to prevent these furloughs,"" Democratic Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, the chair of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, told CBS News. ""Everyone is in agreement and focusing on the fact that we're going to prevent those furloughs. But unfortunately, with OMB not taking any action at this time, it is very difficult to sit down and finalize what exactly is needed,"" Roybal-Allard added, referring to the White House Office of Management and Budget.Immigration                ICE says foreign students can't take online-only fall classes                              Standoff over funding leaves 13,400 immigration workers facing furlough                              Judge blocks Trump's asylum restriction for border-crossers                              Lawmakers urge ICE to release families together following court order                              Judge orders release of migrant children, citing coronavirus                          More in Immigration            The Trump administration, however, says Congress has all it needs to bailout USCIS. ""The Administration has formally requested the resources necessary to keep USCIS running,"" an OMB spokesperson told CBS News. ""Our hope is that Congressional Democrats accept our proposal to keep the lights on in a responsible manner.""On June 19, Acting OMB Director Russell Vought sent letters to congressional appropriators expressing support for a ""pay-it-forward deficit neutral approach"" to grant USCIS emergency funds. The letters, however, did not specify an amount.""The Trump White House is responsible for requesting supplemental funding, but all they have sent Congress is a one-page letter that provides virtually no information on the shortfall or proposed remedies,"" said Evan Hollander, a spokesperson for the House appropriations panel. ""Despite this egregious lack of communication, House Democrats are closely tracking USCIS' financial difficulties and are prepared to discuss solutions as part of negotiations on the next phase of coronavirus response legislation. So far, Senate Republicans are unwilling to begin those talks.""A Republican Senate aide said House appropriators have not reached out about the USCIS emergency funds. The aide also said the White House has not made a formal request for the funds, noting that Vought's June 19 letter did not include a dollar figure.Roybal-Allard said she and other lawmakers are also asking USCIS to identify the factors — in addition to fewer applications during the pandemic — that precipitated the agency's budget shortfall. Congress has yet to receive a response, she said. ""COVID is definitely a factor, but I don't believe that it is the whole reason that we are in this situation. And that's exactly what we're trying to find out, so that it can be corrected and we don't end up in the same place next year,"" she said.""A recipe for disaster""In May, USCIS attributed the agency's potential bankruptcy to a ""dramatic"" drop in applications during the pandemic, predicting that it would see a 61% decline in petition receipts through the end of September. An agency spokesperson said receipts ""have slightly improved"" since, but noted that the $1.2 billion request to Congress remained ""unchanged.""There is consensus among lawmakers, congressional staff, immigration experts and USCIS employees that the pandemic has had a large impact on the agency's operations and fee-funded model. USCIS had to postpone in-person interviews, fingerprint and photo appointments, naturalization ceremonies and other services because of the coronavirus. Though some have reopened in a limited capacity, virtually all offices were closed to the public in the spring. The agency has recently conducted smaller naturalization ceremonies, but hundreds of thousands of immigrants seeking to finalize their path to U.S. citizenship are still waiting to complete their postponed appointments. However, there's disagreement over whether the coronavirus is the sole catalyst of USCIS' dire financial predicament. Lawmakers, experts, former USCIS officials and current employees believe the agency's fiscal crisis had been brewing well before the coronavirus became widespread in the U.S., fueled by the Trump administration's restrictive immigration policies and funding priorities.USCIS publicly forecast a $1.26 billion deficit in November 2019, when it proposed fee hikes for a wide-range of its services. A recent analysis by the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute shows that revenue from petition fees has declined in the past three consecutive fiscal years — a trend that ran parallel to dwindling petitions for programs the administration has limited or sought to dismantle entirely. In fiscal year 2019, USCIS brought in $13 million less in fee revenue than in 2018, which had already seen a $152 million drop in petition funds from the previous year.Between fiscal years 2017 and 2019, USCIS has seen a significant drop in petitions for family-based green cards, naturalization, including from U.S. service members, and programs that protect certain immigrants from deportation, like Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, and the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The Trump administration has sought to end the TPS and DACA programs, but its efforts have been stymied by the courts. It has also taken unilateral action to restrict family-based immigration, including by imposing a broad wealth test for green cards that is expected to disproportionately affect low-income applicants. Citing the economic impact of the pandemic, President Trump has recently issued two sets of restrictions to limit immigrant and work visas.""Over the last four years, the policies of this administration and the way that they ran things pushed the agency to the very edge of a cliff — and COVID was the finger on the back that sent it over,"" a USCIS employee who requested anonymity to speak freely told CBS News. Another USCIS employee, who also requested anonymity and had received a furlough notice, agreed, noting the agency recently expanded its fraud detection and national security units. ""To double the size of a directorate that doesn't actually perform the core function of our agency — which is to adjudicate requests for immigration benefits — is a recipe for financial disaster,"" the employee told CBS News.USCIS pushed back on this criticism. ""There is nothing in the budget or the analysis to suggest that there is any drop in our receipts that is outside historical norms based on any policy that has been implemented during this administration,"" a spokesman said. ""In fact, the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 was better by $100M than fiscal year 2019 and far better ($200M) than it was in 2016, which should illustrate just how far receipts fell in late March forward due to COVID-19.""León Rodríguez, who led USCIS during President Barack Obama's second term, said the current situation could highlight the value of having some of the agency's offices, like those for processing asylum and refugee requests, transition from a fee-funded model, to one appropriated by Congress. ""Because both asylum and refugee work are so bound up with U.S. foreign policy — and the humanitarian and national security strategic objectives of U.S. foreign policy — it makes sense for that to be a shared investment of all the American people,"" Rodríguez told CBS News.Michael Knowles, an asylum officer and president of the union for USCIS employees in the Washington, D.C. area, said he doesn't think the American public has fully grasped the consequences of his agency's potential partial shutdown. ""Millions of people will be affected, not just people who have yet to come to the U.S., but millions who are here. Millions of workers who depend on their work permits. Millions of lawful, tax paying residents who deserve to become citizens.""Knowles said he's still hopeful Congress and the administration may reach a compromise before August 3, noting that the two branches have frequently acted ""at the last minute"" during crises.Sara Cook contributed to this report."

It doubled again to 400,000 cases over the next 20 days.The upward trend in Africa is starting to resemble other parts of the world that have been badly hit by the coronavirus. Most African countries are now experiencing community transmission, according to the WHO.This is when a person gets Covid-19 without having been in contact with a known case from abroad or a confirmed domestic case, which makes it hard for for the authorities to track down the source of a local outbreak.Where are Africa's hotspots?The two countries with the highest numbers of cases are South Africa and Egypt. They accounted for over 60% of all the new cases reported in late June.South Africa has the highest recorded number of total cases, while Egypt has the largest number of recorded coronavirus deaths.South Africa, which imposed one of the world's strictest lockdowns in late March, has seen cases rise steadily after this was relaxed in early May.The Western Cape province (where Cape Town is located), accounts for nearly half of all cases in the country and more than half of the deaths. But cases are steadily rising in Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg.Egypt has seen case numbers rising rapidly since mid-May, but there are indications that this may now have reached a peak

Current analysis suggests a lower mortality rate in younger people. But there are still five countries with death rates that are comparable to or higher than the most recent global average rate of 5% deaths from confirmed cases: Chad (8.5%)Algeria (6.6%)Niger (6.2%)Burkina Faso (5.5%)Mali (5.3)Githinji Gitahi, the head of Amref Health Africa, an NGO which specialises in health matters, says the higher rates could be an indication of much higher infection levels than those being recorded, but it could also be as a result of relatively low levels of testing. The fewer tests you carry out, the fewer confirmed cases you find, and so the number of deaths appears relatively high.The WHO says using community surveillance, where community health workers and other frontline staff report Covid-19 deaths, could be behind the high death rate reported, for example, in Chad.How much testing is done in Africa?Ten countries account for about 80% of the total tests conducted - South Africa, Morocco, Ghana, Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda, Mauritius, Kenya, Nigeria and Rwanda.There are wide variations in testing rates, with South Africa doing the most and Nigeria doing relatively few, according to Our World in Data, a UK-based project which collates Covid-19 information.On 4 July, South Africa was doing just over 30 tests per 1,000 people, compared with 72 in the UK and 105 in the US. Nigeria is achieving 0.7 tests per 1,000 people, Ghana 10 and Kenya 3.It's worth pointing out that for some African countries, it is impossible to know what exactly is happening due to a lack of any data or data being incomplete.""We have to take the numbers with a pinch of salt,"" says Chiedo Nwankwor, a lecturer in African affairs at Johns Hopkins University in the US.In Tanzania, President John Magufuli has voiced doubts about the validity of virus testing results at the national laboratory, and has allowed only limited data on infection rates and testing to be made public. Equatorial Guinea had a row with the WHO after accusing its country representative of inflating the number of Covid-19 cases.  For a while it held back its data, but has now started sharing it again.And in Kano state in northern Nigeria, an unusual spike of close to 1,000 deaths was reported in late April, but the government has not still confirmed how many were due to Covid-19.Note: The graphics in this page use a different source for figures for France from that used by Johns Hopkins University, which results in a slightly lower overall total. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands.GLOBAL SPREAD: Tracking the coronavirus pandemicGLOBAL TRENDS: Where are cases rising and falling?SYMPTOMS: What are the symptoms of the coronavirus?TRACKER: Coronavirus cases in AfricaRead more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
